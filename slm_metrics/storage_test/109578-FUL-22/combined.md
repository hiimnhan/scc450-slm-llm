Wardell Armstrong LLP (WA) has been commissioned by PBS Group to prepare a scheme of air quality mitigation sufficient to discharge pre-commencement planning condition 21 of Trafford Council’s (TC) decision notice for the consented development situated at 46 — 50 Railway Street, Altrincham. Condition 21 of the decision notice is written as follows:
“Prior to works commencing on site, a report/scheme detailing steps to minimise exposure to air pollution shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme is to be completed prior to occupation of the development and shall be permanently maintained thereafter”.
REASON: In the interests of amenity of the future occupiers of the apartments hereby approved, having regard to Trafford Core Strategy Policies: L5.13 and L7.3 and advice within the NPPF. The condition requires the submission of information prior to the commencement of development because the approved details will need to be incorporated into the development at design stage.
The scheme of air quality mitigation detailed within this statement has been prepared in accordance with consultation undertaken with TC’s Pollution and Housing Team.
1.2
GM10750/FINAL NOVEMBER 2019
2 CONSULTATION
2.1 Consultation was undertaken with Ms Nasreen Ali, Environmental Health Officer for TC, by telephone and email communication on 20" to 22"? November 2019. A summary of the consultation is provided below.
Details regarding the consented residential-led development were discussed, including the location of the development within Altrincham and its proximity to the A538 and the Greater Manchester Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). It was confirmed by WA that all residential dwellings, within the four blocks that comprise the development (i.e. Blocks A — D), will be serviced by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) units. The MVHR units will provide whole house continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery to achieve the ventilation rates required by Approved Document F of the building regulations.
2.2
It was proposed by WA that the MVHR units servicing the residential floor within Block C, the closest block to the A538 and the Greater Manchester AQMA, would be adapted to include an air pollution filter (capable of filtering NOz, PMio and PMa:s). The filter would be maintained throughout the life of the development. It was discussed that this form of mitigation is, in principle, appropriate for the residential use of Block C. However, Ms Ali raised the requirement to consider the necessity of air pollution filtration throughout the other development blocks (i.e. A, B and D).
a3
2.4
Given the lack of onsite air quality information currently available for the development site, a potential mitigation option was discussed. Specifically, the discussed strategy would comprise installation of air pollution filters to all of the MHVR units servicing the residential dwellings across the entirety of the development site in the first instance. Subsequently, onsite assessment works would be undertaken to establish where the filters should be maintained, throughout the life of the development, and where they can be removed. Ms Ali provided an agreement to the proposed approach.
2 CONSULTATION GM10750/FINAL NOVEMBER 2019
3 MITIGATION SCHEME 3 MITIGATION SCHEME
3.1 The residential dwellings, within the four blocks that comprise the development (i.e. Blocks A — D), will be serviced by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) units. The MVHR units will provide whole house continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery to achieve the ventilation rates required by Approved Document F of the building regulations.
3.2 All of the MVHR units will be adapted to include a Nuaire carbon filter (capable of filtering NOz, PMio and PM2:s) prior to any occupation of the residential dwellings (details regarding the relevant Nuaire carbon filter product range can be viewed here: https://www.nuaire.co.uk/residential/iaq-carbon-filter). All of the carbon filters should be maintained throughout the life of the development, to ensure that the filters are continuously operating in accordance with manufacturers specifications, or until evidence has been provided, and agreed with TC, that one or more of the MVHR carbon filters can be removed.
33 Evidence to support the removal of an MVHR carbon filter will need to be based on onsite air quality assessment works. The scope and methodology for any onsite air quality assessment works will need to be discussed and agreed with TC, prior to the works being undertaken. At this stage, it is considered that onsite air quality monitoring, comprising NO2 diffusion tube monitoring for a minimum period of three months, possibly supplemented with detailed air quality modelling would be a suitable scope of works for the assessment of onsite air quality.
It is considered that the above approach is suitable for discharge of planning condition 21 of TC’s decision notice for the consented development situated at 46 — 50 Railway Street, Altrincham.

Introduction
The document is to be read in conjunction with the planning application submitted on behalf of the property owner by Eden Planning on the 7th November 2022.
dismantle and rebuilding of the façade at 46-50 Railway Street is a conservation approached process and has been developed in line with the Blackett-Ord conservation engineers report.
Blackett-Ord report has been issued to all key stakeholders that will be involved in the dismantle and rebuild of the façade and will be referred to during each phase of the works described below.
The key matters for consideration within the Blackett-Ord report have been identified within Appendix D.
A measured survey of the façade has been produced and issued to the LA this will be utilised during the reconstruction.
windows will be carried out in accordance with the planning application submitted on behalf of the property owner by Eden Planning on the 7th November 2022.
iron gates will be completed as set out below.
A. Carefully remove existing iron gates and hinge sets
B. Clean the Iron Gate with Wire Brush removing any loose materials
C. Use Sandpaper Against the Surface of Rusted Iron
D. 4.Remove the Rust on the Surface of Wrought Iron Gate: Using Hammerite Rust Remover Gel or similar approved
E. Wash the Iron Gate with mild detergent and warm water. Remove Any Residue.
F. Apply 1 coat of Dulux Metalshield Zinc Phosphate Primer or similar approved containing rust inhibitors in it to keep the gate free from rust.
G. Apply 2 coats of Dulux Metalshield paint or similar approved to finish- RAL 7022
H. Store in a safe location on site until external works are completed to allow for reinstallation.
I. On reinstatement of the gates lubricate all hinges and latches using spray WD40 lithium grease or similar approved.
J. Install two lockable gate latches to either side of the gate to hold the gates in a fixed open position at all times
The proposed works to The Downs, former Nick’s bar, 46 -50, railway street, Altrincham will be carried out by McGoff Construction Limited (MCL) and its appointed subcontractors who have been appointed by the building owner as main contractor.
This deconstruction assessment and methodology statement has taken due cognisance and been prepared to read in conjunction with the Annotated verticality drawing and cross-referenced Blackett-Ord report extracts contained within Appendix C below
Appendices McGoff Deconstruction Methodology Report 5th November 2022 The Downs, former Nick’s bar, 46 -50, Railway Street, Altrincham
1.1 1.1
Experienced subcontractors under the supervisor of McGoff Construction Limited (MCL) on behalf of the owner will undertake Works on site.
Operatives conducting the deconstruction works will report to the site project manager to receive a full site induction including clear explanation as the conservation approach to the façade works.
1.1 All method statements, risk assessments and the Blackett-Ord report will be read fully understood and signed before all works commence.
1.2 1.2
1.2 The works will be conducted on the public footpath on Railway Road in combination with access from inside the site to enable a safe system of works and observing the conservation matters contained within the Blackett-Ord report.
1.3 1.3
An application to close the public footpath and adjacent road has been submitted to the LA by Amberon traffic management on behalf of MCL as the plan contained in Appendix B, Mr Ian Elliot (LA) in his email
Dated 15th July 2022 confirmed this was acceptable and therefore could be put in place.
1.4
Before works commence the footpath and road closure area will be set up therefore cordoning off the work area from the public and maintain complete segregation whilst the works are carried out.
1.5
A general-purpose access scaffold will then be erected within the footpath closure to afford operatives access to remove signage etc. therefore exposing the existing brickwork. A qualified electrician will then isolate any lighting etc. on the façade and remove from site.
1.6
The timber wall plates will need to be removed in the first instance, this will be effected via a hydraulic MEWP & scaffold access, once the timber wall plates have been removed, the facade brickwork will then be dismantled by hand starting from the top down.
In the top down approach to dismantling the wall, operatives should only work from a level partially above the loose bricks and there should be no site personnel at ground level in the vicinity of the works. This will be part of the briefing to operatives / sub-contractors.
This is also important to determine how released /loose bricks will be passed off the scaffolding to ground level and therefore the live load design of the scaffold working platforms and / or the MEWP capacity.
Each course of brickwork will be cleaned, palletised, shrink wrapped & labelled up then transferred onto site where it will be stored in a dry place, this methodology will be constantly repeated whilst the deconstruction team will be conducting regular visual checks on the wall as the height reduces during the process.
McGoff Deconstruction Methodology Report 5th November 2022 The Downs, former Nick’s bar, 46 -50, Railway Street, Altrincham
1.7
Regular checks will be conducted by MCL site management monitoring any potential vulnerabilities appearing in the wall during the dismantle process.
Next to the adjoining building (Double Tree restaurant) which is not a party wall, there is an existing double skin wall that is connected at the interface of the façade wall on Railway Street, this has been left in position to support the façade wall, this will also need to be dismantled by hand including the chimney breasts and will need to run in line with the dismantling works to the façade wall.
At all times on the gable wall dismantle, diagonal support lines will be maintained to assist in keeping the integrity of support at the interface section of both walls.
When working on the reduction of the side gable wall and remaining chimneybreasts it is worth noting that structural matters resulting from the first floor removal and the fractured / incomplete nature of the stone hearths. Removal of bricks may require mechanical means, It is therefore worth noting that the voids could be filled with brick and once the risk of loose bricks from above has been removed from both the front elevation and the side wall the risk of soot damage / dilute sulphuric acid within the flue will also reduce this may mean less dismantling to the sidewall than the front wall.
1.8
To the rear of the façade wall there is also raked brick walls offering support, as the façade is reduced these supporting raked walls will also be dismantled top down running in line with the reduced height of the façade thus affording lateral support during the works.
During the dismantling of the façade at the point where the works become coincidental with lintel these will be inspected by a consultant engineer to establish if they are still fit for purpose and if not these will be removed and replaced with new lintels designed by the engineer and introduced during reconstruction.
In accordance with the Blackett-Ord report the façade wall will be reduced in height sequentially to a level were the integrity of the wall increases sufficiently to allow it to be safely inspected by a consultant engineer. The engineer’s inspection will determine adequate stability of the remaining wall that could then be retained and receive upon it the reconstruction of the façade to its original height and detailing.
All works incorporated with the double skin wall next to the restaurant will be notifiable to the property owner and if necessary communicated daily as part of the progress reports that will be undertaken.

Introduction Introduction
This structural conservation engineering report has been prepared in response to instructions received from Consensus Property Limited. The agreed brief was as follows:
Visit the property and undertake a non-intrusive visual inspection from ground level of those parts of the property that are deemed safe to access.
Review current engineering proposals, based upon the current condition of the building.
Prepare a report providing our advice on the way forward, giving just regard to the property being within a conservation area, but not statutory listed, or locally listed.
Trafford Council have issued a Section 77 Notice dated 08th April 2022, to obviate danger and ensure the safety of the chimney stack and front façade. Removal of the stacks and the upper part of the gable wall has been responded to and completed. The proposed action in respect of the façade has not yet reached an agreement with the Authority as to the scope of works necessary.
Access to undertake our visual inspection was provided to us on 16th May 2022. Our inspection was visual, non-intrusive and undertaken on foot. We consider this to be entirely appropriate as concerns are held by both the Council and the Contractor that what currently remains of the structure is unsafe. A view we shared when on site. It is our experience that working in close proximity to a partially dismantled structure needs to be approached with the up most care and regard to health and safety. As such we regularly use our knowledge of the construction of similar buildings of similar age and our experience of their hidden condition and make a balanced decision.
We also had the benefit of recent aerial photographs to assist our inspection planning, decision making and thought processes.
As CARE registered engineers we understand the relevant Heritage legislation and policies and the resulting need to minimise any intervention and airing towards retention when considered feasible. We regularly provide advice on sensitive buildings for both public and private sector clients.
This report has been prepared for the sole use of Consensus Property Limited, their agents and appointed professionals. It is not to be relied upon by any third party and shall not be distributed to other parties, other than statutory authorities, funders, or insurers, without the consent of Blackett-Ord Conservation Ltd.

Introduction 3
Historical Background Historical Background
The building, formerly a public house is located just outside The Downs Conservation Area and the Character Zone B, known as The Downs Commercial Area. (Ref:
Trafford Council Conservation Area Appraisal – October 2014 and the Trafford Council Conservation Area Management Plan – March 2016.). It does however sit within the boundary of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. (Ref: Trafford documents of the same dates.).
46 Railway Street appears on tithe plans, between 1835 and 1852. Prior to this there was a more narrower building at the front of the plot. The double fronted two storey building, with basement, and a side access to the rear yard, was known as The Downs Hotel. Prior to being painted the front elevation would have matched attachent exposed brick elevations with low rise arched window heads and stone cills. The hotel later became a public house.
Blackett-Ord Conservation Engineering

The Conservation Area Appraisal considers the building a landmark and providing a positive contribution to the Conservation Area. The elevation visible in the image above is currently covered by a site advertising hoarding.
Historical Background More recently, and prior to our appointment, a previous contractor has removed the roof, the first flloor, ground flloor, internal walls and rear wall of the building. The basement has also been filled with polystyrene blocks to ground level. This has left the front elevation without adequate lateral restraint.
Structural Observations Structural Observations
General Structural Form
From what remains of the building and from our knowledge of traditional buildings of this date, we would describe the original structural form as loadbearing brick under a pitched timber and slated roof, with timber first and ground floors.
Whilst the building would appear to have been present since circa 1835, it was not constructed to an exceptional standard, representing common construction techniques of the time. Also, it has not remained unaltered. This is often the case with buildings that provide a community function and there is evidence of previous interventions and changes. Some of which resulted in the removal of the cellular robustness of the original building, with not all changes being coordinated or providing continuity of the structural form or sympathetic aesthetics of the façade.
The occupational use as a hotel and a public house suggests that the missing internal configuration of the property would have undergone periodic ad hoc alteration to adapt to changing needs and customer expectations over time. We have seen previously these can lead to structural discontinuity and weaknesses. What was evident from our inspection of the rear of the façade is that what remains of the righthand wall, is a modern cavity wall with galvanised twisted wire ties. This is not an original nineteenth century construction and is indicative of significant past changes to the building. It is our view that this wall does not currently provide sufficient structural restraint to the front elevation. Visual evidence of diagonal stress cracking of the plaster reinforces this opinion
middle of the building there is a single 102mm thick brick wall that does not currently provide sufficient structural restraint to the front elevation. There is also visual evidence of diagonal stress cracking of the plaster as well as a tapering gap between the wall and the rear of the facade.
left hand side there are separate walls forming the boundary between the two properties. There is a tapering gap between these two walls, that was approximately 125mm at slate level. Both walls appear to be 225mm thick. The wall for the adjoining property presents as stretcher bond bringing into question whether it is structurally stable under wind loading.
Our experience of similar nineteenth century buildings of this size and construction suggests we should consider the presence of timber lintols behind the low rise brick arch lintols. Potentially, also of consideration, is the common use of bonding timbers built into the inner wall face at corners and cross walls. All of which become
Blackett-Ord Conservation Engineering

problematic when they decay and effectively reduce the thickness of the wall. The presence of these could not be verified due to areas of internal dry lining.
General Structural Form From the historic mapping and the evident different dates of construction materials, it is possible that at first floor and roof of the Hotel passed over the alleyway to the rear courtyard. With the alleyway being one bay remote from the bank building. This would suggest that some time prior to the Conservation Area appraisal a considerable part of this building was lost due to alterations. Furthermore, alterations to the elevation have been made including the installation of Upvc windows.
Residual Structural Issues Observed Residual Structural Issues Observed
following residual structural issues were observed from ground level from within the footprint of what now remains of the original building:
lowered gable wall with the adjacent property has some loose brickwork.
chimney breasts that remain change size over their height and at first floor level (and possibly ground floor level) parts of the brickwork are supported on timber joists and stone flags.
construction and stability of the exposed gable wall of the adjoining property is undetermined. Visually the brickwork appears to be stretcher bond and as such it is not known whether this adjacent wall is 112mm thick or greater. At present it is susceptible to high wind loadings that it may not be capable of sustaining. It appears to be the case that each adjacent property has its own wall, the removal of the gable wall will allow the neighbouring property to inspect their wall and undertake any remedial works necessary.
There appears to be two rows of timber wall plate at the top of the front façade, one where the roof jack rafters connected (upper) and open at the head of the first-floor windows. (lower). This lower wall plate may act as a timber lintol over the first-floor windows. Timber internal lintol and brick voussoir arch externally.
The brickwork above the lower wall plate appears to be 225mm thick and below the wall plate 327mm thick. The change in thickness occurring at the first-floor window head level. The timber wall plate appears to be decayed.
removal of the first-floor timber joists has left pockets in the façade, sufficiently above the ground floor window heads to suggest that there may be an internal timber lintol present above and behind the brick voussoirs.
brick arch behind the sandstone arch lintol above the central main entrance door, is above the level of the first floor, but there appears to be timber still built into the wall thickness.
Prior to the removal of the building, there is evidence that would suggest that water entry into the building had been occurring for a prolonged period of time. What remains of internal plaster and brickwork has evidence of vegetation growth. When we examined the bricks that were being retained it was apparent that where original mortar was lime, the mortar had freely de- bonded from the clay brick. This would indicate that water saturation of the walls had resulted in the degrading (de-carbonation) of the lime mortar.
Bricks that had come from the lowered chimney stacks were heavily sooted and cracked, suggesting a combination of heat fractures and sulphate
Blackett-Ord Conservation Engineering

contents that could be harmful. These flue bricks should not be reused in the building.
Both cross walls that remain do not provide adequate restraint to the front façade wall. Diagonal cracking evident in the remaining plaster and tapering gaps at their junction with the front wall are indicative of overstressing and movement.
overall thickness of the front façade wall was undeterminable because internally it is lined with boarding and timber stud and externally it is covered with an advertising hoarding.
condition of the basement structure is unknow as it is filled with polystyrene blocks. We were advised that asbestos-based products may remain in the basement. The basement would have been utilised as the beer cellar and as such we would expect both barrel drops and coal holes to be present from the public pavement level to the basement. These could not be identified internally due to the filling nor externally due to changes in the public realm surfacing. Experience tells us that these are local risks to the integrity of the wall, often caused by corrosion of embedded metalwork.
From the historic mapping, where the single storey building has been removed was probably the entrance to the rear yard. Certainly, brickwork in all walls is more modern. The opening into the yard with the concrete lintol, was we would suggest originally another building, possibly outbuildings associated with the hotel along the wall of the adjacent bank building. The lintol is likely to be at the end of its design life and unsuitable for any increase dead weight being added above it.
The junction with the ‘Bank’ building may be considered as a Party Wall scenario.
Options
Using our experience, visual inspection and relatively recent aerial photographs we have considered the following options for the existing front wall:
Type of Intervention Issues Do nothing This would be in breach of the Section 77 Notice. It would not address future deterioration of the structure. It would not make the remaining structure safe or enable a safe working environment to be developed. It would continue to be a risk to the general public. Undertake further survey work. This would breach the timescales set in the Section 77 notice. A verticality check would not negate the overriding lack of bond between mortar and bricks. Dimensional survey could be undertaken during dismantling to assist in rebuilding but would not add to the decision-making process that is

Demolition of the façade. overridden by condition rather than deformation of the façade. Mortar testing can be useful in deciding on the mix of the mortar to use in reconstruction, but will not inform the mortar condition, which will be variable and different in different locations. Further surveys would result in the structure remaining exposed to the elements and continue to deteriorate. Adds no additional information to what has already been seen and assessed from experience. Requires the removal of the front hoarding. Requires the partial removal of internal drylining to expose the rear face of the brick wall. Even if this could be done safely, in our view there is insufficient remaining cross walls that are in themselves weak and lacking adequate support. Vibration from the installation could dislodge un- bonded brickwork risking uncontrolled collapse. The depth of the basement cannot be safely confirmed as the vibration from ground investigation / installation of shores could dislodge un-bonded brickwork. The condition of the basement retaining walls cannot be safely verified. The ground conditions below the basement level cannot be safely investigated. Same issues as the internal façade retention system plus - The extensive safe working zone required would result in the closure of the whole junction. - Likely result in delays and prolongation of risk and deterioration of condition. Un-controlled demolition from a distance could result in unknown modes of wall failure due to the variable loss of bonding between bricks and their mortar.
Large exclusion zones including road closures
and surface protection.
Not a conservation approach because variable
amounts of historic fabric could be lost due to
damage.
Dismantling of the façade.
Dismantling can be controlled and can be done
by hand from hydraulic platforms.
Dismantling can stop when mechanical effort
needs to be applied to the removal of bricks. (i.e

Options when the mortar bond is sufficiently strong to allow lateral loads to be resisted. Material can be salvaged and set aside for reuse. The risk of disproportionate uncontrolled collapse is mitigated.
Recommendations Recommendations
The structural situation that has been left by others would normally suggest the need for a façade retention system. Structurally this should have been designed and erected prior to the removal of the roof, floors, and parts of the cross walls. It would have also been possible at that time to design a system that minimised the disruption to the public realm, by being erected almost entirely from within the footprint of the building.
Whether the façade has moved, is moving, or not moving does not change the fact that it is inadequately restrained and of undeterminable structural integrity. Monitoring the façade will not add knowledge to this or inform or alter the situation currently presenting. Neither is it necessary to consider the precise angle of the façade as observations confirm it is unsafe, and this is not contested by the Council (evidenced by the s77).
Likewise, it is apparent that the gable wall has moved historically and is also currently compromised by the changes in wall profile being supported on the remains of timbers and fractured stone fire hearths.
Fundamentally a safe method of working cannot be developed to allow the installation of a temporary restraint system to the front façade. There are too many unmanageable risks to even allow sufficient investigations to be undertaken into ground conditions and basement construction to design such a system.
From both a safety and structural viewpoint the recommended action now needed is to continue to dismantle the building by hand from remote hydraulic platforms. Dismantling from the top down we see as being progressive and if the integrity of the wall is found to become more robust at a lower level, then dismantling could cease. From a conservation engineering viewpoint this could be achieved following a dynamic recording of the dimensions, details and materials of the façade together with salvaging suitable materials for future reuse. It also ensures that the minimum amount of historic fabric is lost.
We have proposed and successfully delivered several similar projects within busy city centre environments, as well as rural settings, when a brick wall has been exposed to prolonged weathering and internal cross wall restraint to it has been compromised or lost due to decay in floors, or embedded timbers. We have also found that once a sound level has been reached, there is no need to provide façade retention, providing subsequent works are progressed in a timely manner and the wall is then tied into the new works.

Next Steps
We would suggest the following:
Consult with the Local Planning Authority to determine the scope of consents required to dismantle the remaining building including the façade onto Railway Street. Including the preparation of a detailed methodology.
Review the opportunities to rebuild the façade and to reuse existing materials, possibly to improve the overall appearance by gap filling at first floor level and turning bricks to present a brick finish rather than a painted finish to the street view. Discuss this strategy with the Local Planning Authority.

1) What was evident from our inspection of the rear of the façade is that what remains of the right-hand wall, is a modern cavity wall with galvanised twisted wire ties. This is not an original nineteenth century construction and is indicative of significant past changes to the building. It is our view that this wall does not currently provide sufficient structural restraint to the front elevation. Visual evidence of diagonal stress cracking of the plaster reinforces this opinion
2) At the middle of the building a single 102mm thick brick wall does not currently provide sufficient structural restraint to the front elevation. There is also visual evidence of diagonal stress cracking of the plaster as well as a tapering gap between the wall and the rear of the facade.
3) At the left hand side there are separate walls forming the boundary between the two properties. There is a tapering gap between these two walls, that was approximately 125mm at slate level. Both walls appear to be 225mm thick. The wall for the adjoining property presents as stretcher bond bringing into question whether it is structurally stable under wind loading.
4) Our experience of similar nineteenth century buildings of this size and construction suggests we should consider the presence of timber lintols behind the low rise brick arch lintols. Potentially, also of consideration, is the common use of bonding timbers built into the inner wall face at corners and cross walls. All of which become problematic when they decay and effectively reduce the thickness of the wall. The presence of these could not be verified due to areas of internal dry lining.
5) The lowered gable wall with the adjacent property has some loose brickwork.
6) The chimney breasts that remain change size over their height and at first floor level (and possibly ground floor level) parts of the brickwork are supported on timber joists and stone flags.
7)There appears to be two rows of timber wall plate at the top of the front façade, one where the roof jack rafters connected (upper) and open at the head of the first-floor windows. (lower). This lower wall plate may act as a timber lintol over the first-floor windows. Timber internal lintol and brick voussoir arch externally.
8) The brickwork above the lower wall plate appears to be 225mm thick and below the wall plate 327mm thick. The change in thickness occurring at the first-floor window head level. The timber wall plate appears to be decayed.
McGoff Deconstruction Methodology Report 5th November 2022 The Downs, former Nick’s bar, 46 -50, Railway Street, Altrincham
9) The removal of the first-floor timber joists has left pockets in the façade, sufficiently above the ground floor window heads to suggest that there may be an internal timber lintol present above and behind the brick voussoirs.
10) The brick arch behind the sandstone arch lintol above the central main entrance door, is above the level of the first floor, but there appears to be timber still built into the wall thickness.
11) Prior to the removal of the building, there is evidence that would suggest that water entry into the building had been occurring for a prolonged period of time. What remains of internal plaster and brickwork has evidence of vegetation growth. When we examined the bricks that were being retained it was apparent that where original mortar was lime, the mortar had freely de- bonded from the clay brick. This would indicate that water saturation of the walls had resulted in the degrading (de-carbonation) of the lime mortar.
12) Both cross walls that remain do not provide adequate restraint to the front façade wall. Diagonal cracking evident in the remaining plaster and tapering gaps at their junction with the front wall are indicative of overstressing and movement.
13) The condition of the basement structure is unknown as it is filled with polystyrene blocks. We were advised that asbestos-based products may remain in the basement. The basement would have been utilised as the beer cellar and as such we would expect both barrel drops and coal holes to be present from the public pavement level to the basement. These could not be identified internally due to the filling nor externally due to changes in the public realm surfacing. Experience tells us that these are local risks to the integrity of the wall, often caused by corrosion of embedded metalwork.
14) Fundamentally a safe method of working cannot be developed to allow the installation of a temporary restraint system to the front façade. There are too many unmanageable risks to even allow sufficient investigations to be undertaken into ground conditions and basement construction to design such a system.

1. Introduction
1.1
1. Introduction This Heritage Addendum has been prepared by Paul Butler Associates on behalf of McGoff Construction Ltd in support of a revised planning application relating to the former Downs Hotel, 46 – 50 Railway Street, Altrincham, WA14 2RE. The site is located within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. 46 – 50 Railway Street which historically occupied the site has been identified as a non-designated heritage asset.
1.2 The description of development is: 1.2 The description of development is:
‘Demolition of the front façade wall and other remaining elements of the former Nicks Bar building, including the entrance archway and the erection of a two storey building comprising a ground floor mixed use commercial and business floor space (Use Class E), with a single residential apartment (Use Class C3) above, the erection of a replacement entrance archway and other associated works’
1.3
A Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment prepared by Dickenson Waugh Conservation (‘the DWHS’) was issued in February 2021 and submitted in support of a previous application at the site which included the retention of the building’s façade. This Heritage Statement assessed the significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street, other affected heritage assets and the impact of the scheme on the significance of those assets.
1.4
The scheme now proposed broadly reflects that which has previously been approved. In addition to some minor design changes, the key change is in relation to the building’s historic façade which is now proposed to be deconstructed, and a replacement building of the same design constructed in its place. Historic fabric will be salvaged and re-used where possible. This Addendum report therefore considers the conservation impact of the
amended scheme, and should be read alongside the DWHS.
1.5
The deconstruction of the façade has been confirmed as being necessary, as set out within a Structural Assessment prepared by Blackett-Ord who are CARE-Accredited Engineers.
1.6 This Addendum includes:

is understood to have originally been constructed in c.1835 and was historically known as The Downs Hotel. Figures 1 – 4 illustrate the site and its immediate surroundings (Site visited on 30 October 2022). The majority of the building has been demolished, with a part single, part two storey façade being the single remaining element. The single storey element to the south is 2 bays wide, with a cart / vehicle accessway to the left and window with canopy to the right.

The main part of the façade to the right is three bays, with the window and door composition still easily read. Historic window frames appear to remain in-situ to upper floors. A wooden frame has been attached to the ground floor of the building to provide some protection and previously had an advertising wrap / hoarding attached.

The BO Report The BO Report
2.3
A ‘Structural Review of Front & Gable Elevation Stability Report’ was prepared by Blackett- Ord (‘the BO Report’) and issued in May 2022. This set out the results of a visual inspection, a review of the then-current engineering proposals (which had formed part of the previous planning consent), and set out recommendations. Based on a structural assessment of the façade, the BO Report noted the following:

▪ That the façade is inadequately restrained and of undeterminable structural integrity.
integrity.
▪ The remaining part of the gable wall is currently compromised by the changes in the wall profile being supported on the remains of timbers and fractured stone fire
hearths.
A safe method of working cannot be developed to allow the installation of a temporary restraint system to the front façade.

That the façade should be dismantled by hand. Should the integrity of the wall be found to be more robust at lower level, then dismantling could cease.
▪ The recording of the dimensions, details and materials of the façade together with salvaging suitable materials for future re-use would minimise potential loss and maximise potential re-use of historic fabric.
2.4
It is understood that progressing this strategy as soon as possible is necessary, for safety reasons, as well as in light of temperatures dropping this winter (2022) which could result in further structural instability, and loss of historic fabric.
The Surrounding Area
2.5
The site is bounded to the north by the 2 storey 42 - 44 Railway Street (restaurant use at ground floor, apartments at first floor level) and the 3 storey 2 – 4 The Downs to the south (former RBS Bank at ground floor, apartments above). Both buildings are of historic merit, but neither are nationally Listed (See Figures 3 and 4).
2.6
The surrounding area is largely characterised by mixed use developments and features a broad range of building types/ages/styles including mainly smaller two / three storey mixed use buildings and less common larger 4 plus storey buildings. Building materials range from red brick, bronze brick and painted brick with a mixture of sloped and flat roofs. The site is located within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area, and part of a wider development site which extends into the neighbouring Downs Conservation Area. The site is situated within Altrincham Town Centre and is therefore in a highly accessible and sustainable location.

3. The Proposed Scheme 3. The Proposed Scheme
3.1
The proposed scheme comprises the deconstruction of the remaining part of the building, and the erection of a two storey building comprising a ground floor commercial unit and first floor residential apartment. The proposed building has been designed to reflect the building which historically occupied the site, and will include the erection of a replacement entrance archway. During the deconstruction works, historic fabric will be salvaged and re- utilised within the scheme where possible. Planning permission has previously been granted for a broadly similar scheme.
Background and Reasons for Application
Planning Permission Ref 95548/FUL/18 was secured on 7 June 2019 for a scheme which included the demolition of side and rear extensions to 46 – 50 Railway Street, the conversion of the ground floor of the building for commercial use, and the conversion of the upper floor to an apartment (See Table 3.1). This was as part of a scheme which also included the construction of new build residential development to the rear.
3.2

3.3
A further planning permission was secured on 27 July 2021 (Ref: 103419/FUL/21) which related solely to 46 – 50 Railway Street. This was for a development broadly similar to that approved by planning permission 95548/FUL/18 but which included for additional demolition of the building with just the façade to be retained.
3.4
Associates Paul Butler Since approval of 103419/FUL/21, the building has been mostly demolished with just the street-facing façade remaining. Structural advice has confirmed that the façade is not structurally sound and must be deconstructed.
The Proposals The Proposals
3.5
As set out in the BO Report, the retention of the historic façade and its incorporation into the proposed scheme is not possible, and its structural condition requires that it is deconstructed as soon as possible (See Para 2.3 above). The BO Report and McGoff Report include recommendations as to how the works can be carried out safely and sensitively, whilst maximising the historic fabric which can be reincorporated into the proposed building. Where this is not possible, materials will be sourced which are reflective of surrounding historic buildings and the character of the Conservation Area.
Consultation with Trafford Council
3.6
Extensive discussions have taken place between the applicant, its design team, and Trafford Council (TMBC) since Council officers alerted the applicant regarding the façade’s potential structural instability in April 2022. Whilst TMBC are now satisfied that the façade should be deconstructed, they have determined that such works would not be within the scope of the extant planning permission 103419/FUL/21 and requested that a further planning application be submitted.
3.7
This Addendum is therefore submitted in support of a Planning Application which seeks consent for the deconstruction of the façade, and the construction of a replacement building, which seeks to replicate the design of the building which historically occupied the site.

4. Key Policy / Guidance Review 4. Key Policy / Guidance Review
4.1 The introduction of the DWHS set out the key policy and guidance referred to in the undertaking of the heritage impact assessment. This comprised:
▪ British Standard 7913:2013 ‘Guide to the Conservation of Historic Buildings’
National Planning Policy Framework (2019)
Historic England Guidance:
Planning 1 ’The Historic Environment in Local Plans’ (2015).
Planning: 2 ‘Managing Significance in Decision-Taking in the Historic Environment’ (2015).
Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning: 2 ‘The Setting of Heritage Assets’ (Second Edition) (2017)
Advice Note 12 ‘Statements of Heritage Significance: Analysing Significance in Heritage Assets’ (2019)
‘Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance’ (English Heritage 2008)
Trafford Core Strategy (2012).
4.2
The above documents remain the key policy and guidance relevant to the application proposals. Since the DWHS was issued in February 2021, there has been a further update to the NPPF (July 2021) but this has not resulted in any policy implications relating to the proposed scheme. The relevant heritage policy and guidance which have been considered in the preparation of this Addendum are summarised within Appendix A.
5. Statement of Significance
5.1
The DWHS was submitted in support of application 103419/FUL/21 which was approved on 27 July 2021. This included a Conservation Area Contextual Assessment (Section 3), a Historic Interest and Heritage Values (Section 4), and a Statement of Significance (Section 5). These
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum


5. Statement of Significance By
Paul Associates Butler Paul Associates Butler
Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
sections identify the heritage values and historic significance of the site and other affected heritage assets. This Heritage Addendum should be read alongside these sections.
5.2
Paragraph 1.5 of the DWHS confirmed that the ‘significance’ of heritage assets was assessed in accordance with the policy and guidance set out at Paragraph 4.1 above. An Addendum to the DWHS was also prepared following a meeting with TMBC officers on 22 April 2021 which considered some minor changes to the proposed scheme as well as the necessity for the removal of rear walls. This did not however affect the conclusions of the DWHS.
5.3
The affected heritage assets and their key elements of significance as set out within the DWHS, and which are relevant to the current planning proposal (which includes the deconstructing and reconstruction of the building’s façade) are summarised below.
Stamford New Road Conservation Area
5.4
Section 3.3 reviews the summary of the Conservation Area’s special interest as set out within the Conservation Area Appraisal. The following is of note:
▪ The focus of the Conservation Area is along the gentle curve of Railway Street and Stamford New Road leading to Altrincham Interchange.
The designation combines early 19th century development along Railway Street with a cohesive group of good quality late 19th and early 20th century buildings along Stamford New Road and adjoining streets, testifying to the prosperity and confidence of the town.
Building elevations fronting the street display a variety of good quality architectural styles, detailing and expression, particularly to upper floors, which contribute a high level of aesthetic and historic value to the Conservation Area.
There are a number of consistent design details for example the use of splayed corners and plaques with names, initials and dates displayed.
Generally, buildings sited along Railway Street are 2 storeys in height and domestic in scale increasing to 3 storeys and a larger scale along Stamford New Road and some adjoining streets.

Buildings tend to be traditional in form with pitched roofs and front the street.
The scale, massing, and form of buildings results in a strong building line and sense of enclosure, this contributes to the visual interest and rhythm of the streetscene.
▪ The consistent use of traditional building materials and local details repeated throughout the Conservation Area provides a sense of visual harmony. The majority of buildings are constructed from red brick laid in traditional bonds with pitched blue slate roofs and painted timber windows.
5.5
A description of 46 – 50 Railway Street is set out within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal (CAA). This describes the building prior to its near total demolition. Whilst some of what is described is lost (i.e. ‘pitched roof cladded with blue slate’), the description does note that ‘The windows on the ground floor are tall in shape and have stone sills and headers, the first floor windows are vertical sliding sash windows which are painted in white. The entrance of the building has a solid wooded panelled door that has two decorative corbels beside it’. The then-current and former uses of the building (hotel and subsequently public house) are noted, with a concluding comment that ‘The building reflects the traditional former uses in the area. It illustrates the development of the settlement in which it
stands’. (DWHS Section 3.1)
46 – 50 Railway Street
5.6
In relation to the building itself, Section 4 of the DWHS includes an assessment of the building’s heritage value (as at February 2021) and focuses on those elements which would be affected by the proposals at that time.
5.7
In terms of ‘historic interest’, the building being illustrative of a significant period in local history representing a period where the town was experiencing enormous growth and positive change is noted (Para 4.2.2). The building’s origin and historic purpose is noted as being associated with the railway and the extension to the Bowdon Terminus (Para 4.2.3). The building is identified as a local landmark, holding some communal value and noting that this is perhaps as ‘part of a group than individually, but local residents will draw some pride and sense of place from historic buildings such as this’ (Para 4.2.4).
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum


46 – 50 Railway Street 11

Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
The ‘archaeological interest’ of the building is set out. It is noted that the building retains little if anything of value internally. The internal spaces are of course lost following demolition of the majority of the building. Also lost is the then-remaining chimney stack to the southern gable, and it is noted that externally ‘the building has received extensive modern intervention, broadly cosmetic with the significant features still evident’ (Para 4.3.3). These significant features along with the relationship between the building (as ‘tangible evidence’) and the history / evolution of the area are therefore the key elements of archaeological interest.
5.8
5.9
Associates Paul Butler The ‘architectural and artistic interest’ is identified as comprising the building’s retention of its architectural form and its historic identity. The Heritage Statement notes that ‘The painted brick somewhat detaches it visually from its contemporaries but it still presents as a significant structure along the street-scene’ (Para 4.4.2).
Summary of Significance Summary of Significance
5.10
Section 5 of the DWHS provides a Statement of Significance. It confirms that the building is not regarded in any way to be of exceptional or high significance. Medium significance is attached to the building’s ‘associative, illustrative and communal values’ in terms of it acting as a contributory reminder of the historic development of the town; its architectural interest (albeit diluted by modern intervention and limited to its façade) and its impact when viewed from within the public realm. The now-demolished structure behind the facade is identified as being of neutral value, with intrusive elements comprising harmful ‘low quality’ alterations to the building’s architectural appearance, which has also caused harm to the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area (Para 5.2).
5.11
In terms of historic significance, the Statement concludes that this ‘considered to be LOW to MEDIUM and is limited to what remains of the original building which both serves as a reminder of its, and the local area’s history and contributes to the character of the Conservation Area’. The ‘frontage of the building and significant elements which can be viewed from the highway’ are identified to be of greatest significance, with the façade of the building maintaining ‘both its presence and its aesthetic contribution’.

Associates Paul Butler 5.12 Whilst there have been some minor policy changes since the DWHS was completed and some additional guidance published, none of this would impact upon the way the report was completed or its findings and the statement of significance is therefore regarded as being up to date. Notwithstanding this, it is noted that the ‘low to medium’ level of significance has diminished further due to the loss of some further elements which contributed to that significance. The historic significance of the remaining part of the building (its façade) is considered to be ‘low’.
6. Impact on Significance 6. Impact on Significance
6.1 The DWHS included an ‘Impact Assessment’ (Section 7) which assessed the impact of the proposed scheme on the basis of Historic England guidance.
6.2
It is understood that the development proposed as part of the application resubmission will result in a development which broadly reflects that which has been previously approved under the planning consents within Table 3.1, but with the existing façade to be deconstructed (rather than retained). The purpose of this Section within this Heritage Addendum is to consider whether or not the impact of the now-proposed scheme (which includes the deconstructing of the building façade – the single remaining intact feature of the building) varies from that which has previously been assessed and approved by TMBC, and if it does, whether such impact is acceptable in conservation terms.
6.3
Section 7 within the DWHS noted that the replacement of PVC windows with timber windows will reinstate historic consistency in terms of material use and quality, whilst the proposals would also retain the presence of the building and its illustrative, associative and communal values. Whilst the proposal is now to deconstruct the remaining part of the building and for it to be reconstructed using a mixture of sympathetic new and salvaged materials from existing, the positive conservation aspects of the scheme mentioned within the Statement are retained.
6.4
The DWHS also considers the impact of the proposed scheme on two viewpoints from within the Conservation Area. In relation to the impact upon these views, the Statement notes:
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum


6. Impact on Significance 13,
Paul Associates Butler Paul Associates Butler
Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
‘The retention of the façade of the building and its southern gable, together with the neighbouring low-level frontage and cart entrance, albeit non-original, is clearly important to preserving associative, illustrative and communal values and also the historic character of the area. The demolition and reconstruction work to the rear of the building will have no perceivable impact. The proposed changes to the frontage of the building will bring about positive change, primarily to the aesthetics within the views, but also the authenticity and integrity of the quality of the buildings within the views.’
It is noted that the demolition of the rear of the building (which has since taken place) will have no perceivable impact, and the positive change resulting from the approved proposals will broadly remain subject to the implementation of the scheme now proposed. It is noted that the ‘changes to the front of the building are wholly positive’ and also that once complete, ground floor public house use could be reinstated at some future point thereby reinstating an historic use. In terms of mitigation, the Statement notes:
6.5
‘The demolition of the structure to the rear of the façade will of course result in the loss of a small amount of historic and original building fabric, although nothing of particular importance in terms of features or craftsmanship. The building holds no greater value than its contribution to the Conservation Area and the preservation of its presence and architectural integrity overwhelmingly mitigate against any perceived loss.’
6.6
Paul Associates Butler The scheme as now proposed will of course result in the loss of the building’s façade which is the key element of its contribution towards the Conservation Area. However, the reconstruction of this in complementary materials, along with the construction of a building behind which is of the historic proportions and materiality of the former building will improve the site’s contribution to the streetscape and ultimately the character of the Conservation Area.
Impact Assessment Impact Assessment
6.7
The proposed scheme will impact upon the significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street and the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. In accordance with national policy and guidance,

a balanced judgement is therefore required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the non-designated heritage asset; whilst the harm to the Conservation Area (a designated heritage asset) must be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal.
6.8
46 – 50 Railway Street which previously occupied the site was identified as a non-designated heritage asset by virtue of it being identified as a positive contributor to the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. The Conservation Area is a designated heritage asset and contains multiple other designated and non-designated heritage assets. This Heritage Addendum has therefore reviewed the relevant parts of the DWHS and undertaken a supplementary assessment in support of the now proposed scheme. The proposed scheme broadly seeks to achieve approval for a similar scheme to that which was previously approved at the site under Planning Permission 103419/FUL/21, but includes for the
deconstruction of the building’s façade.
Paul Associates Butler The impact of the scheme on the affected heritage assets is considered below.
Impact of the Scheme on the Heritage Significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street Impact of the Scheme on the Heritage Significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street
6.10 Whilst the significance of 46 – 50 Railway Street has arguably already been lost due to its near-total demolition, it is clear from CAA, the DWHS, and from this Heritage Addendum that the part which remains standing was the building’s most significant element. The application proposals will result in the total loss of this non-designated heritage asset. NPPF Paragraph 203 therefore requires a balanced judgement to be had having regard to the scale of any
loss (which is total) and the significance of the heritage asset (which is low).
Impact of Scheme on the Heritage Significance of The Conservation Area
6.11
The Stamford New Road Conservation Area’s special interest is summarised within Section 5. Prior to the demolition of much of the building, 46 – 50 Railway Street had been identified as a ‘positive contributor’ to the Conservation Area. Further to the demolition of the rear part of the building, the site now detracts from the special interest of the Conservation Area. The building’s façade (which was previously accepted as the primary element of this contribution) is now all that remains.
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum


Impact of Scheme on the Heritage Significance of The Conservation Area 15,
Paul Associates Butler Paul Associates Butler
Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
The application proposes the deconstructing of the building’s façade which once complete will have a negative impact upon the character of the Conservation Area, simply due to it removing a structure which currently encloses a short section of Railway Street, as it has been since the construction of the building in the early to mid 19th Century. The application proposals include the construction of a building on the site, including the re-creation of the building’s façade (including brick arches, soldier courses, and stone bands), and the building’s roof (including the re-use of salvaged blue slates and chimney pots). The reconstructed building façade will see the re-use of salvaged materials, the use of a red brick reflective of surrounding red brick heritage assets within the Conservation Area, the reinstatement of architectural features, and the use of timber windows and doors which reflect the character of the Conservation Area in the way that the existing PVC windows and doors do not.
6.12
6.13 Whilst the historic interest of 46 – 50 Railway Street was ultimately limited, the most significant aspect of this was identified as being its association with the rapid expansion of Altrincham in the 19th Century, particularly in relation to the arrival of the railway. The reconstruction of the building in the same architectural style and utilising complementary / salvaged materials ensures that this link can continue to be understood. Furthermore, the use of a brick which reflects the building’s original and historic appearance arguably enhances the site’s contribution to the character of the Conservation Area.
6.14
The proposed scheme is therefore regarded as having a significant positive impact upon the character of the Conservation Area, and a positive impact upon the settings of designated and non-designated heritage assets therein. Whilst the original building will be totally lost, its visual contribution to the Conservation Area will be greater than at any point in recent decades. The re-use of the site which will include commercial use at ground floor
level will further enhance this contribution.
6.15 Whilst no harm to the Conservation Area has therefore been identified, in accordance with NPPF Paragraph 202 any perceived harm (which it is assumed would be regarded as less than substantial) resulting from the scheme should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal. These are extensive and include:

Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
Repurposing a presently vacant and derelict site which occupies a prominent position, fronting an arterial road into the town centre.
The wider regeneration benefits associated with The Downs Quarter development and the benefit this will bring to the town centre.
Contribution towards the housing land supply, at a time the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year housing land supply position.
Ensuring the delivery of residential development and commercial floorspace in a sustainable and accessible location.
6.16
Reference to the BO Report confirms that the remaining part of 46 – 50 Railway Street was found not to be structurally sound, and the deconstructing of the façade is therefore necessary as a matter of urgency. The application proposals therefore constitute the best and only option in terms of maximising the heritage benefits of a development proposal at the site.
Mitigation
6.17
Prior to its substantial demolition, 46 – 50 Railway Street contributed positively to the character of the Stamford New Road Conservation Area. Its own significance as a non- designated heritage asset had been limited due to the extent of intervention and change, and this significance has been further diminished following the demolition. The building’s greatest significance had been its contribution to the character of the Conservation Area, and the application proposals present an opportunity not only to restore that contribution, but also to enhance it. This enhancement is partly achieved through the conservation mitigation which forms part of the scheme, and which includes:
▪
The design of the façade and roof of the replacement building which reflects the historic design of 46 – 50 Railway Street in terms of design features, and new and salvaged materials.
▪ The incorporation of a brick that reflects the elevational treatment of the building and is more in-keeping with the character of the Conservation Area, resulting in the visual harmony between the site and Conservation Area which the CAA identifies as a key element of its character.
as a key element of its character.
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum

Associates Paul Butler Associates Paul Butler
Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
▪ The sensitive deconstructing of the building’s façade so that original building fabric can be re-utilised where possible. A Method Statement has been developed by McGoff Construction in line with a Conservation Engineers Report prepared by Blackett-Ord.
▪ The proposed building’s continued part commercial use at ground floor level, and the provision of accommodation at first floor level which broadly reflects the historic site uses.
6.18
Subject to the incorporation of the above mitigation, the application proposals are regarded as being acceptable in policy terms, due to the harm resulting from the total loss of a non-designated heritage asset which is of low significance, being outweighed by the significant positive impact upon the Stamford New Road Conservation Area (a designated heritage asset). It is also acknowledged that the harm associated with this proposal is greater than the previous application 103419/FUL/21. However, the harm is outweighed by the low significance of the non-designated heritage asset, and the public benefits that the proposals will produce. As is concluded within the BO Report, the application proposals are regarded as the single development option available and subject to successful
implementation, will maximise the heritage benefit to the site.

Appendix A – Policy Review
The heritage planning policy of relevance to the proposed scheme, and which provides the context for its assessment, is set out within national and local planning policy guidance. These policies have been considered in the preparation of this Addendum.
been considered in the preparation of this Addendum.
Section 38(6) of the Town and Country Planning Act 2004 states that applications for development should be determined in accordance with the Development Plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. In the case of Trafford Council, the adopted Development Plan consists of the Core Strategy (adopted 2012) and the saved policies of the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan. Due consideration in the determination of the application will also need to be afforded to national policies in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which represents a significant material consideration.
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF)
Detailed guidance about the legislation is given in National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which was first published on 27th March 2012 and last updated on 20 July 2021 and sets out the Government's planning policies regarding the conservation of the historic environment. The original NPPF and its subsequent updates are a key part of reforms to make the planning system less complex and more accessible; to protect the environment; and to promote sustainable growth. It replaces all previous planning policy guidance and is a material consideration in planning decisions.
The NPPF places great emphasis on the role of decision makers to promote sustainable development. Paragraph 8 advises that sustainable development has three dimensions: ‘economic, social and environmental’.
In relation to determining planning applications, the NPPF sets out a presumption in favour of sustainable development. For decision taking this means approving development that accords with an up-to-date development plan without delay (Paragraph 11).
Section 16 of the NPPF deals with conserving and enhancing the historic environment. Paragraph 194 advises that ‘In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum


National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 19,

their setting’. This statement demonstrates that the information and significance requirements of national policy have been complied with.
195 of the NPPF advises that ‘Local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset’s conservation and any aspect of the proposal’.
196 states that ‘Where there is evidence of deliberate neglect of, or damage to, a heritage asset, the deteriorated state of the heritage asset should not be taken into account in any decision’.
197 of the NPPF advises that ‘In determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of: a) the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; b) the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and c) the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness’.
199 of the NPPF advises that ‘When considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance’.
Paragraph 200 advises that ‘Any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification. Substantial harm to or loss of a) grade II listed buildings, or grade II registered parks or gardens, should be exceptional; b) assets of the highest significance, notably scheduled monuments, protected wreck sites, registered battlefields, grade I and II* listed buildings, grade I and II* registered parks and gardens, and World Heritage Sites, should be wholly exceptional’.
46 – 50 Railway Street Heritage Addendum


20,
Associates Paul Butler
Development Heritage Planning, Consultants &
Paragraph 201 advises that ’Where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of significance of) a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss, or all of the following apply:
the nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site; and
no viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through
appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation; and
conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and
the harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use’.
Paragraph 202 advises that ‘Where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use’.
Paragraph 203 advises that ‘The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset ’.
Annex 2 of the NPPF provides a glossary of key terms which are relevant to this application. ‘Significance’ is defined as: ‘The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations because of its heritage interest. The interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting ’.
‘Setting of a heritage asset’ is defined within Annex 2 as ‘The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral’.

National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG)
The National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) is a web-based resource which was launched in March 2014 and coincided with the cancelling of the majority of Government Circulars. It provides guidance on many aspects of planning including plan-making and decision taking.
It states ‘Heritage assets may be affected by direct physical change or by change in their setting. Being able to properly assess the nature, extent and importance of the significance of a heritage asset, and the contribution of its setting, is very important to understanding the potential impact and acceptability of development proposals’.
In relation to the setting of a heritage asset, the NPPG states ‘A thorough assessment of the impact on setting needs to take into account, and be proportionate to, the significance of the heritage asset under consideration and the degree to which proposed changes enhance or detract from that significance and the ability to appreciate it.
Setting is the surroundings in which an asset is experienced, and may therefore be more extensive than its curtilage. All heritage assets have a setting, irrespective of the form in which they survive and whether they are designated or not.
extent and importance of setting is often expressed by reference to visual considerations. Although views of or from an asset will play an important part, the way in which we experience an asset in its setting is also influenced by other environmental factors such as noise, dust and vibration from other land uses in the vicinity, and by our understanding of the historic relationship between places. For example, buildings that are in close proximity but are not visible from each other may have a historic or aesthetic connection that amplifies the experience of the significance of each
contribution that setting makes to the significance of the heritage asset does not depend on there being public rights or an ability to access or experience that setting. This will vary over time and according to circumstance.
When assessing any application for development which may affect the setting of a heritage asset, local planning authorities may need to consider the implications of cumulative change. They may also need to consider the fact that developments which materially detract from the asset’s

significance may also damage its economic viability now, or in the future, thereby threatening its ongoing conservation’ (Paragraph 013 Reference ID: 18a-013-20140306).
Paul Associates Butler With regard to assessing substantial harm, National Planning Practice Guidance advises: ‘Whether a proposal causes substantial harm will be a judgment for the decision taker, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the policy in the National Planning Policy Framework. In general terms, substantial harm is a high test, so it may not arise in many cases. For example, in determining whether works to a listed building constitute substantial harm, an important consideration would be whether the adverse impact seriously affects a key element of its special architectural or historic interest. It is the degree of harm to the asset’s significance rather than the scale of the development that is to be assessed. The harm may arise from works to the asset or from development within its setting.’ (Paragraph: 017 Reference ID: 18a-017-20140306).

Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal (2014)
The Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal describes the contribution made by the building as follows:
This building reflects a substantial number of other elements in the Conservation Area in age, style, materials and form. This 2 storey property with painted brickwork has a pitched roof cladded with blue slate. The windows on the ground floor are tall in shape and have stone sills and headers, the first floor windows are vertical sliding sash windows which are painted in white. The entrance of the building has a solid wooded panelled door that has two decorative corbels beside it. The building was formerly The Downs Hotel, later a public house. The building has an irregular form and a symmetrical composition. The building reflects the traditional former uses in the area. It illustrates the development of the settlement in which it stands.

Altrincham Altrincham
WA14 2RE
This document is to be read in conjunction with the Heritage Statement and Impact Assessment prepared by Dickinson Waugh Conservation and dated February 2021 (the heritage statement).
This document has been prepared by the author of the heritage statement in response to a request by the local authority for additional information relating to conservation as required in order to determine the planning application, and follows a meeting on site with the Planning Officer Cormac McGowen and Conservation Officer Elisabeth Lewis on the 22nd April 2021.
Following the meeting, further amendments were made to the proposals, specifically:
Retention of gates to be fixed open;
• Widening of the access;
Rebuilding of historic chimney;
Refurbishment of existing windows; and,
Retention of the existing slate roof tiles.
These are shown on the current drawings prepared by Calder Peel.
significance of the building and the contribution it makes to the distinctive character and appearance of the Conservation Area is clearly set out in the heritage statement.
current proposals are considered to reverse previously harmful alterations which were carried out to the building.
The impact of the proposals on the architectural interest attributed to the building and its setting are clearly positive and the proposals serve to enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.
With regard to the request for a more substantial explanation for the demolition of the rear walls; this was necessary in order to facilitate the delivery of the wider proposals permitted under application ref: 95548/FUL/18.
The building is defined as a non-designated heritage asset due to the contribution it makes to the Conservation Area and this is primarily related to the façade, and to a lesser degree the flanking wall. The rear and internal walls and structure hold no appreciable heritage value.
Regardless, the heritage statement and existing floor plans confirm that there was very little left of the original structure due to previous invasive alterations that had been carried out to the building.
The applicant has worked to ensure the elements of historic interest and that contribute to the Conservation Area, including roof tiles, chimney stacks and the distinctive features on the principal elevation are stable and capable of sensitive and informed reinstatement and restoration.

HERITAGE STATEMENT AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The retention of the existing façade, the upward and outward extension of the existing archway, and the erection of a two-storey building comprising a ground floor mixed used commercial and business floorspace (Use Class E), with a single residential apartment (Use Class C3) above, together with associated works to a Non-Designated Heritage Asset.
1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1
This assessment has been carried out in order to determine the impact of proposed alteration and reconstruction works on a Non-Designated Heritage Asset which is situated within a Conservation Area. The appraisal is concerned with the process of conserving the special architectural and historic interest of the building and preserving or enhancing the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area.
1.2
This appraisal has been conducted in accordance with the general guidelines set out in British Standard 7913:2013 ‘Guide to the Conservation of Historic Buildings’ and in particular responds to policies outlined in the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (NPPF). In respect of information requirements, paragraph 189 sets out that:
“In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets’ importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on their significance.”
1.3
Guidance on the implementation and interpretation of historic environment policy has been provided by the Historic England publications ‘Historic Environment Good Practice in Planning’ notes 1 ’The Historic Environment in Local Plans, GPA2 ‘Managing Significance in Decision- Taking in the Historic Environment’ and GPA3 ‘The Setting of Heritage Assets’ (Second Edition).
1.4
Planning policy for Altrincham comprises the ‘Trafford Local Plan – Core Strategy’ which was adopted in 2012. This assessment has been carried out with consideration given to Core Strategy Policy: R1 – Historic Environment.
Policy R1.1 sets out that:
All new development must take account of surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.
Policy R1.2 sets out that:
Developers must demonstrate how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings, in particular in relation to conservation areas, listed buildings and other identified heritage assets.
With specific respect to Conservation Areas, Policy R1.3 sets out that:
Trafford’s Conservation Areas will be identified within the Land Allocations’ DPD. Within these areas the Council will:
Carry out, and update where necessary, Conservation Area Appraisals, to inform the production of new and revised Supplementary Planning Documents;
Develop Management Plans for existing Conservation Areas;
2
• Determine applications for demolition, taking account of the contribution made by the building or structure to the character, appearance or special architectural interest of the area as a whole, including the merits of any proposed (re)development. Where development is to follow demolition, it will be a requirement that detailed planning permission for the proposed redevelopment shall be obtained and the implementation of that proposal is secured before the existing building or structure is demolished; and
• Require developers to demonstrate how the proposed development will preserve or enhance the Conservation Area, and its wider setting in the light of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and area specific guidance notes.
1.5
Significance has been assessed in accordance with guidance as set out in Historic England Advice Note 12 ‘Statements of Heritage Significance: Analysing Significance in Heritage Assets’ and the former English Heritage document entitled ‘Conservation Principles, Policies and Guidance’

LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION LOCATION AND SITE INFORMATION
2.1
46-50 Railway Street (the building) is a historic mid C19th Hotel originally known as The Downs Hotel, and former Public House which is situated at National Grid Reference SJ 76670 87609 and lies to the north of the junction of The Downs, Ashley Road, Lloyd Street and Railway Street.
2.2
The building is situated within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area of Altrincham and is adjacent and close to the border with The Downs Conservation Area.
2.3
The building is identified within Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal as a ‘key contributor’ to the historic character and appearance of the area and is therefore defined as a non-designated heritage asset.
2.4
Non-designated heritage assets are defined by Historic England as ‘buildings, monuments, sites, places, areas or landscapes identified by plan-making bodies as having a degree of heritage significance meriting consideration in planning decisions but which do not meet the criteria for designated heritage assets’.
The building is also highlighted within the Conservation Area Appraisal as a local landmark.

3.0 CONSERVATION AREA CONTEXTUAL ASSESSMENT
3.1
The Stamford New Road Conservation Area Appraisal describes the contribution made by the building as follows:
This building reflects a substantial number of other elements in the Conservation Area in age, style, materials and form. This 2 storey property with painted brickwork has a pitched roof cladded with blue slate. The windows on the ground floor are tall in shape and have stone sills and headers, the first floor windows are vertical sliding sash windows which are painted in white. The entrance of the building has a solid wooded panelled door that has two decorative corbels beside it. The building was formerly The Downs Hotel, later a public house. The building has an irregular form and a symmetrical composition. The building reflects the traditional former uses in the area. It illustrates the development of the settlement in which it stands.
The Conservation Area Appraisal reports the condition of the building as ‘fair’.
3.3
The summary of Conservation Area’s special interest as set out within the appraisal and to which the building contributes is as follows:
•
The focus of the Conservation Area is along the gentle curve of Railway Street and Stamford New Road leading to Altrincham Interchange. The predominate land use of the area tends to be commercial and retail on ground floors with offices, storage or some residential on upper floors.
•
The designation combines early 19th century development along Railway Street with a cohesive group of good quality late 19th and early 20th century buildings along Stamford New Road and adjoining streets, testifying to the prosperity and confidence of the town.
•
Building elevations fronting the street display a variety of good quality architectural styles,
detailing and expression, particularly to upper floors, which contribute a high level of aesthetic
and historic value to the Conservation Area. There are a number of consistent design details
•
for example the use of splayed corners and plaques with names, initial and dates displayed.
Generally buildings sited along Railway Street are 2 storeys in height and domestic in scale increasing to 3 storeys and a larger scale along Stamford New Road and some adjoining streets. Buildings tend to be traditional in form with pitched roofs, and front the street. In a number of cases the plot ratio is greater in depth than width, although there are some exceptions. The scale, massing and form of buildings results in a strong building line and sense of enclosure, this contributes to the visual interest and rhythm of the streetscene.
•
There are a number of significant pedestrian routes, ginnels and open spaces which contribute to the finer grain and spatial interest of the Conservation Area. There are often good views from these routes to the plainer, often unaltered and functional historic rear elevations, outriggers and outbuildings which contribute positively to the integrity and evolution of the Conservation Area.
•
The consistent use of traditional building materials and local details repeated throughout the Conservation Area provides a sense of visual harmony. The majority of buildings are constructed from red brick laid in traditional bonds with pitched blue slate roofs and painted
6
timber windows. There is variation in the tonal range of red brick and embellishment is usually picked out in terracotta, gauged brick or sandstone. There are smaller numbers of buildings constructed from sandstone or white brick.
•
The area is defined by the railway, both historically and physically. Railway Street was renamed in 1849 with the advent of the railway. Stamford New Road was created after 1880 when Altrincham and Bowdon Station replaced the two earlier stations. The name declares the importance of the Earl of Stamford as a major landowner in the area. In the second half of 20th century Altrincham Station was developed to accommodate a significant transport interchange and in 2014 is undergoing major refurbishment.
4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES
4.1
In assessing proposed changes to the building, an appraisal of the significance of the elements due to change has been carried out. This process relates to the assessment of a range of heritage values as outlined by Historic England; formerly English Heritage in the 2008 guidance document which have been revised for the 2017 draft document.
These values are distilled under the following headings: Historic Interest (including Communal Interest), Archaeological Interest (formerly Evidential Value) and Architectural and Artistic Interest (formerly Aesthetic Value). The purpose of assessing these values is to enable an assessment of the site’s significance - whether physically manifest (e.g. architectural features) or in some other less tangible form (e.g. historical associations) - so as to enhance the objective appraisal of proposals for the change to the building.
In essence this follows the approach generally advocated by Historic England, whereby necessary change in the historic environment is intelligently managed. A brief summary of the heritage values associated with the site, and more specifically those parts due to change under the proposals being considered, is given below, together with an indication on how these values contribute to the appraisal of significance
Historic Interest (Historic / Communal Value)
4.2.1 Historic England consider that historical interest “can illustrate the story of past events, people and aspects of life” (EH.2017.s28). This is generally regarded as either Illustrative whereby the building or element can be perceived to represent a period in history, Associative where a connection with an event or person can contribute to the historic significance of a site or Communal; where the it may invoke emotion or contribute to an individual’s or community’s sense of place or where a place can be a form of catalyst for memories associated with it or.
4.2.2 The building is illustrative of a significant period in local history and is one of the many buildings which represents a period where the town was experiencing enormous growth and positive change.
4.2.3 The building’s origin and historic purpose is associated with the railway and the extension to the Bowdon Terminus.
7
4.2.4 The building is a noted local landmark and holds some communal value, perhaps more as part of a group than individually, but local residents will draw some pride and sense of place from historic buildings such as this.
Figure 2. Historic image circa 1912. The Downs Hotel evident with polychromatic brickwork to the now demolished neighbouring building. Note the location of the cart entrance being on the other side to where it exists today.
4.3 Archaeological Interest (Evidential Value)
4.3.1 Described by Historic England as “evidence of past human activity” (EH.2017.s38), archaeological interest is derived from one’s ability to interpret the history and historic evolution of an asset through visible and tangible features whether superficially evident or that could be revealed through investigation.
4.3.2 The building retains little if anything of value internally and has been heavily modified so extensively that interpretation of historic room arrangement and plan form is not reasonably possible on any informed basis. The chimney stacks to the north side party walls remain whereas the one to the southern gable as evident in Figure 2 has been lost.
4.3.3 Externally the building has received extensive modern intervention, broadly cosmetic with the significant features still evident. The remains of the neighbouring building which was lost some years ago appear to be non-original with the cart access having been relocated, this significantly devalues this section of the building.
4.3.4 The introduction of the railway defined the development of the area thereafter and therefore, buildings which came about as a result of the railway remain as tangible evidence of this and the evolution of the character of the area during the middle to latter part of the C19th.
8
Architectural and Artistic Interest (Aesthetic Value)
4.4.1 Architectural and Artistic Interest according to Historic England “derives from a contemporary appreciation of the asset’s aesthetics” (EH.2017.s42) and relates to sensory and intellectual stimulation and may be derived from detailed design produced by an architect or designer, or from direct creation by a craftsman or sculptor.
4.0 HISTORIC INTEREST AND HERITAGE VALUES 4.4.2 Notwithstanding the modern changes, the building retains its architectural form and essentially its historic identity. The painted brick somewhat detaches it visually from its contemporaries but it still presents as a significant structure along the street-scene.
5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
5.1
Having assessed the heritage values associated with the site, it is possible to take a more informed approach to the assessment of site significance. This is usually done by attributing levels of significance to the various aspects/parts of a building or site whereby, for example, more modern or unsympathetic additions to a historic building are deemed of less significance than, say, original features.
5.0 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 5.2 In attributing levels of significance to the asset as a whole or elements of the asset, levels of significance are graded as follows:
EXCEPTIONAL EXCEPTIONAL
EXCEPTIONAL This would correspond to an individual Grade I or II* Listed Building or an element which is intact, has a special interest, and makes an important contribution to the wider significance of the building.
HIGH HIGH
HIGH A designated heritage asset which has significance at national level, such as Grade II listed buildings or an element which is relatively intact, has a special interest and makes an important contribution to the wider significance of the building.
MEDIUM MEDIUM
A non-designated heritage asset such as a Locally Listed Building which is considered to be important at a local to regional level or an element which has been altered, has less special interest, and its contribution to the wider significance of the site is less important. May include less significant parts of statutorily Listed Buildings.
Medium significance can be attributed to the building’s associative, illustrative and communal values. Its presence is a contributory reminder of the historic development of the town and is of some importance at local level.
Medium significance can also be attributed to the architectural interest the building holds. Somewhat diluted by modern intervention and limited to the façade, its impact when viewed from within the public realm is of value.
9
MEDIUM 5.3
LOW LOW
LOW A non-designated asset important at a local level such as a building which makes a positive contribution to a Conservation Area (key building) or an element which has been significantly altered, has a low level of integrity, the special interest has been lost and it makes little contribution to the wider significance of the site.
NEUTRAL NEUTRAL
An element which is considered to be historically unimportant but does not have a harmful impact on a heritage asset. This may include insignificant interventions to designated and non- designated heritage assets and buildings that do not make a positive contribution to a Conservation Area.
Neutral significance can be attributed to the remaining structure behind the façade, with most elements of any limited heritage value lost to previous works.
INTRUSIVE
An element which is considered to be historically unimportant and has a harmful impact on a heritage asset.
Intrusive elements are the low-quality changes to the building externally and primarily to the front. Previous alterations have been harmful to the architectural appearance of the building and consequently have also been causative of harm to the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area.
On balance, the overall historic significance of the building in local context is considered to be LOW to MEDIUM and is limited to what remains of the original building which both serves as a reminder of its, and the local area’s history and contributes to the character of the Conservation Area.
This can essentially be narrowed down to the frontage of the building and significant elements which can be viewed from the highway. The façade of the building maintains both its presence and its aesthetic contribution.

6.0 PROPOSAL OVERVIEW
6.1
6.0 PROPOSAL OVERVIEW The proposals comprise the retention of the existing façade including the roof and part of the gable end, the upward and outward extension of the existing archway, and the erection of a two-storey building comprising a ground floor mixed used commercial and business floorspace (Use Class E), with a single residential apartment (Use Class C3) above, together with associated works.
7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 7.0 IMPACT ASSESSMENT
7.1 To follow is a detailed critical analysis of the proposed changes. The purpose of this analysis is to manage the change using methodology as advocated by Historic England (2008) and is categorised as follows:
Proposal: Brief description of the proposal together with an assessment to establish whether there is enough information to comprehensively understand the impact of the proposals on the character and appearance of the Conservation Area
to retain the façade of the building include works to remove the modern window awnings, renovate the sash windows at first floor level (or replace on a like-for-like basis if too damaged) and replace the modern PVC windows at ground floor level with painted hardwood windows. The drawings appear to propose a simpler and modern interpretation of the original window design. The chimney stacks, which are significant indicators of historic plan form as well as important features, are to be re-pointed with lime mortar.
include for raising the opening to what was considered to be the remaining structure and cart entrance to the neighbouring building. This is to allow emergency vehicles to pass through and access the new development to the rear.
Impact: Consideration of the effects of the proposal on authenticity and integrity of the heritage values attributed to the building or area.
The proposed changes to the façade of the building further reveal elements of heritage value which contribute to both its architectural interest and its appearance from within the public realm and are therefore welcomed. The removal of the PVC windows and replacement with painted hardwood units will reinstate historic consistency in terms of material use and quality.
Having been vacant for a period of time, the building appeared to have limited viability for proposals relating to its original and historic use, the proposals retain the presence of the building and ultimately preserve its illustrative, associative and communal values.
The Conservation Area Appraisal identifies views along Railway Street as being ‘Key Views’. Such views are considered important as an integral component in experiencing, enjoying and understanding
12
the historic character of an area. Historic England advocate an approach to assessing heritage within views which is essentially proportionate to the value of the assets within the views:
A. View from the junction at the end of The Downs looking north up Railway Street. The position of this view sits approximately on the boundary of The Downs Conservation Area and is also contributory to its historic character and appearance.
B. View from the station end of Railway Streel looking south towards the road junction at The Downs. The Bank at 1-5 The Downs is very much the focal point of this view and is identified within the Conservation Area Appraisal as a local landmark.
13
The view up Railway Street in both directions is dominated by the large multi-storey developments to the east on the site of the original Bowdon Terminus, but this serves to enhance the importance of the line of historic buildings which run along the west side of the road, to the Conservation Area.
building is prominent within these views, the painted brickwork at least draws the eye towards the side of the road with historic integrity and is arguably a reasonable counter-balance to the mass of the opposing modern development.
retention of the façade of the building and its southern gable, together with the neighbouring low- level frontage and cart entrance, albeit non-original, is clearly important to preserving associative, illustrative and communal values and also the historic character of the area. The demolition and reconstruction work to the rear of the building will have no perceivable impact.
The proposed changes to the frontage of the building will bring about positive change, primarily to the aesthetics within the views, but also the authenticity and integrity of the quality of the buildings within the views.
Reversibility: Whilst the quality of the architecture and intended specification of materials is intended to last the test of time, this is not always a given. Should the proposal not perform as expected, consideration is given to the ease of reversibility so as not to prejudice alternative future solutions.
proposed works to the rear of the building are entirely benign in terms of impact on historic significance and the contribution they make to the character and appearance of the Conservation, and therefore reversibility is not a material consideration.
changes to the front of the building are wholly positive and while the proposals do represent a departure from the building’s original and historic use, flexibility appears to exist whereby the building could function as a Hotel and Public House without the requirement for significant alterations. In that regard, the proposals do not prejudice future alternative solutions.
Mitigation: Consideration of the necessity mitigate the impact of loss of any element of historic significance resulting from the proposals.
The demolition of the structure to the rear of the façade will of course result in the loss of a small amount of historic and original building fabric, although nothing of particular importance in terms of features or craftsmanship. The building holds no greater value than its contribution to the Conservation Area and the preservation of its presence and architectural integrity overwhelmingly mitigate against any perceived loss.
Compensation: Consideration of any consequential conservation-based benefits resulting from the proposal.
14
The proposals clearly retain the most significant elements of the building which contribute to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, while preparing it for continued viable and sustainable use whereby it will not remain unoccupied and its future will be secured in the medium to long term.

8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
8.1
46 – 50 Railway Street, Altrincham is a historic hotel dating from the mid C19th. The building is neither statutorily nor locally listed but does lie within the Stamford New Road Conservation Area of Altrincham as designated and under the authority of Trafford Council.
8.2
The building has been identified within the local authority Conservation Area Appraisal as a ‘Positive Contributor’ to the historic character and appearance of the area and also a local landmark is therefore defined as a ‘Non-Designated Heritage Asset’. The building is also visible from within the neighbouring The Downs Conservation Area to which it also makes a positive contribution.
8.3 The building has struggled since around 2004 to remain in use as a Public House/Bar and has been vacant for some time and as such, alternative uses have been considered.
8.4
The building has been substantially altered and extended in recent years resulting in the loss of its original and historic plan form.
8.5
The façade of the building has been significantly altered in recent years albeit mostly cosmetic but ultimately harmful.
8.6
The heritage assessment section of this document concludes that the building’s presence, identity and architectural interest are of most significance in terms of its contribution to the historic character and appearance of the Conservation Area. This primarily lies within what is visible from the main highways i.e. the façade and southern gable.
8.7
The proposals comprise reconstruction of the building, retaining its façade, carrying out enhancement works to the principal elevation and developing the site for commercial use at ground floor and residential use at first floor.
8.8
This document contends that the proposals result in no perceivable harm to the heritage values attributed to the building and the contribution it makes to the Conservation Area.
8.9 This document also contends that the proposed façade works essentially reverse previous harmful alterations and serve to enhance the contribution the building makes to the Conservation Area.
8.10 The proposals do not prejudice alternative future solutions or the building’s capacity to be adapted for its original use.
8.11 The proposals are therefore consistent with the objectives as set out in local planning policy in terms of:
• Respecting surrounding building styles, landscapes and historic distinctiveness.
• Demonstrating how the development will complement and enhance the existing features of historic significance including their wider settings in relation to the conservation area.
17
• Demonstrating how the proposed development will preserve or enhance the Conservation Area, and its wider setting in the light of relevant Supplementary Planning Documents and area specific guidance notes.
8.12
The proposals are also consistent with the objectives set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (CLG, 2019. S16 Para185) specifically:
a. the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets, and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;
b. the wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits that conservation of the historic environment can bring;
c. the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness; and
d. opportunities to draw on the contribution made by the historic environment to the character of a place.
8.13
It is therefore recommended that the application is permitted subject to conditions set out in accordance with Paragraph 55 of the National Planning Policy Framework ensuring that they are:
1. necessary;
2. relevant to planning and;
3. to the development to be permitted;
4. enforceable;
5. precise and;
reasonable in all other respects.

Façade Painting Specification
Before you paint ensure you have properly prepared the area.
New brickwork with cement mortar should be left to set for a minimum of 28 days before painting.
Check your brickwork for any defects. A build-up of white crystal salts on the surface is called efflorescence and needs to be removed before painting. To remove any efflorescence, wipe down the bricks with a 5% solution of white vinegar and water, hose down then allow to dry.
Check the bricks for any water damage. Any leaks, damp rising or excess moisture will need to be addressed before painting.
Ensure the surface is clear of any loose sand or cement. Fill holes with grouting cement.
Wash down with water using a stiff brush to remove all loose material.
Use a good quality masking tape along any edges you don’t want to paint, including trims or windows.
• Carry out Water Bead test to make sure water soaks into bricks. If not, the paint may not be suitable for the brick type.
Painting your bricks – Dulux Weathershield - RAL 9016 Matt Finish
New Brickwork requires 3 Coats of Dulux Weathershield :
1st coat Mist Coat using Dulux Weathershield Masonry Paint (watered down 15-20%) 2nd Coat Dulux Weathershield Masonry Paint 3rd Coat Dulux Weathershield Masonry Paint
Cut in around the edges and hard to reach areas with an angled brush.
Using an 18-nap roller, load the tray with a reasonable amount of paint.
Start rolling the wall in an ‘M’ pattern. Continue over the same section until the wall is evenly covered. Roll up to area of 1m2 size or paint the wall in sections. Before paint starts to dry, using an unloaded roller, begin in the top left corner of your wall and gently let the roller roll down to the base in a straight line with no pressure. Repeat this action only this time, slightly overlap your last movement so your roller rubs away the line created by the previous stroke. Continue this across the area you have painted. This is called laying off. Once the first coat is dry, approximately 2 hours in normal conditions, repeat the total process again for the 2nd coat then leave to dry before applying a final 3rd coat.
