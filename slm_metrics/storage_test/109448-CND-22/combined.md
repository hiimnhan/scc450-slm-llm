Rackhams re-development: Condition 14 Biodiversity Enhancement Measures Rackhams re-development: Condition 14 Biodiversity Enhancement Measures
Background Information Background Information
Planning permission has been granted for the refurbishment, remodeling and extension of a recently disused development store complex. The development aims to create an office workspace together with retail facilities, food and beverage outlets and leisure amenities.
The buildings associated with the disused development complex are located in the centre of Altrincham, to the west of Stamford Old Road (SJ76927 88009). It is situated in a commercial area which is poorly vegetated and dominated by multistorey built structures. The closest green space John Leigh Park is located over 300m away to the North-East. The buildings are immediately adjacent Altrincham train station to the South-East and surrounded in all other directions by commercial and retail buildings.
As part of the planning application the following condition in relation to biodiversity enhancement measures was included:
Condition: “Prior to any above ground construction work first taking place, a scheme detailing the Biodiversity Enhancement Measures proposed on the site, which shall include bat and bird boxes / bricks, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall be implemented prior to first occupation and retained thereafter”
Background Information This advice note provides details of the biodiversity enhancement measures in relation to the development in order to discharge the condition.
Biodiversity Enhancement Biodiversity Enhancement
A living wall will be installed on one of the buildings within the development (Figure 1). IWANTPLANTS (IWP) living walls provide a number of benefits for biodiversity within urban areas, including energy reduction (thermal insulation), water conservation (reuse, harvesting and cleaning), and habitat creation (pollinators, insects, birds and bats). An increase in bird and bat populations has a positive feedback effect on biodiversity, by reducing the need for pesticides and equipment costs to control pest populations. Additionally, IWP use recycled materials to produce the living walls, the polymer is based from recycled car battery housing and they are manufactured locally in Liverpool.
In terms of the species to be used within the living wall, those which capture high quantities of particulate matter should be favoured. The ability of different species to capture pollutants varies significantly, and a study on a living wall at New Street Railway Station in Birmingham found that common box (Buxus sempervirens), White hebe (Hebe albicans) and common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) had the highest concentrations of particles within their leaves. It was concluded that plants with smaller, hairy and waxy leaves were most effective at reducing air pollution (Weerakkody et al, 2017). Therefore, species with these traits will be selected for use in the living wall.

Bats
A building inspection and dusk emergence survey has been completed previously by Bowland Ecology in August 2021 on the site (Bowland Ecology, 2021). The buildings were assessed as having low to negligible potential to support roosting bats. However, small gaps and crevices within existing buildings, such as damaged brickwork have the potential to be used by opportunistic crevice dwelling species such as pipistrelle. Although the site is located in a densely urban location with extensive light spillage which would deter bats from roosting, a single pipistrelle was observed foraging in the area.
The proposed living wall which will be installed on the eastern elevation of a building (Figure 1) has the potential to increase the suitability of the site for foraging bats as they increase the number of invertebrates in the local area which bats feed on. A study by Pearce et al (2012), found that bat activity was significantly higher over green roofs compared to conventional roofs in the Greater London Area. Additionally, even when there was a low abundance of suitable habitat within the area (less than 33% optimal habitat within 100m), green roofs attracted bats to the area.
Installing bat boxes within the living wall has the potential to offer roosting space for bats. Temperature is one of the main factors influencing the use of artificial roosting sites by bats, particularly in the summer months when they are rearing their young. Therefore, bat boxes should be placed in sheltered areas where maximum sunlight is received. Therefore, they should be located on the south, south-west and south-east facing elevations of the living wall (see suggested locations in Appendix A and suggested bat box types in Table 1). It is important to place bat boxes on various elevations within a development, to provide a number of different options for bats, so that they can choose the most appropriate temperature based on their needs (Bat conservation trust, 2021). The boxes should not be located above the proposed bar/terrace area to minimise the impact of artificial lighting and disturbance.
Artificial lighting has a negative impact on bats, particularly slow flying bats such as Myotis species as they become more visible and therefore vulnerable to attack by predators (Stone et al, 2012). For this reason, no external lighting should be installed pointing directly towards the bat boxes on the living wall. However, if external lighting is installed within the development, unobtrusive, downward facing lighting should be used (Bat Friendly Lighting (kellwoodlighting.co.uk) and the mitigation measures identified in the light assessment will be

employed (NSA-BWB-00-XX-RP-E-0001_LIA page 16). The approach to the bat box should not be impeded by branches and should be facing an unobstructed area to ensure a clear flight path into the box for the bats.

Biodiversity Enhancement Bat box type Specifications Image 3 Schwegler 1FF bat box Dimensions: (W) 27cm (H) 43cm (D) 14cm Weight: 10kg. Description and position: Open at the bottom allowing droppings to fall out and therefore do not require cleaning. To compensate for fluctuations in temperature during the spring and autumn, the bats can choose between the cooler wood concrete or the warmer wooden panel. Should be located at least 3m from the ground with an unobstructed approach. 2 Bat Hibernation Box 1FW Dimensions: External (W) 38cm (H) 50cm. Internal (W) 20cm (H) 38cm. Description and position: Triple and corrugated wooden boards have clinging option with a patented double panel system with several insulation layers Should be cleaned once per year and located at least 3m from the ground with an unobstructed approach.
Birds Birds
survey completed by Bowland Ecology in 2021 identified two feral pigeon nests on the outside of a building. The living wall may attract new birds to the area such as house sparrows, starlings and swifts. Many of these species are migratory and rely solely on buildings in urban areas to nest in, particularly swifts which meet up with the same mate each spring at the same nesting site. Chiquet et al (2013) studied the use of green walls by birds in North Staffordshire, and found that birds never used bare walls, whereas green walls were used by species of conservation concern such as starling and house sparrow for nesting, food and shelter. Additionally, bird activity was always concentrated to the upper half of the wall vegetation.
installation of swift boxes, nest cups for house martins and bird boxes for starlings and house sparrows will create habitat for nesting birds within the living wall (suggested locations shown in Appendix A and bird box types shown in Table 2). A removable shelf can be installed below the boxes to catch droppings and cleaned annually.
