was:
Linked to:
E2 Specialist Consultants Ltd, South Park Way, Wakefield 41 Business Park, Wakefield, WF2 OXJ.
Entry Requirements
In order to enter the SITMA Registered Testers Scheme, testers are required to either:
completed the Institute of Acoustics Certificate of Competence in Building Acoustics Measurements (CCBAM)
been assessed by SITMA to hold suitable, demonstrable evidence of competence in sound insulation testing
Audit Requirements
Each tester is audited at least twice a year, completely unannounced. This is achieved by the tester logging their job onto the SITMA portal in advance of testing taking place. Audits are carried out by independent SITMA employees who have been trained in accordance with ISO 19011:2018 and have extensive background in Sound Insulation Testing. Each tester will be able to issue you with their SITMA audit documentation from their last audit alongside this report, if requested.
SITMA Portal
The SITMA Portal, besides logging every job for every tester, is used to generate reports, just like this one. The portal does not take pre-calculated information, it takes the raw data from 12 different sound level meters and calculates each individual test itself, before producing this report. This ensures that no test data has been amended by any tester prior to the information being uploaded.
Accreditation
will shortly have achieved ISO 17024 accreditation from UKAS (Application number 10579). SITMA has completed the Initial Audit and is awaiting final confirmation.
Calibration Requirements
SITMA holds some of the strictest calibration requirements in the world for sound insulation testing, with each sound level meter and tapping machine requiring UKAS calibration every 2 years and the microphone calibrator requiring calibration each 12 months. If the tester does not hold correctly calibrated equipment, the SITMA portal will not let them produce this report.
Complaints
You should speak directly with the tester if you wish to make a complaint. If your complaint is not handled to your satisfaction, you are then welcome to make a complaint directly to the SITMA registered testers scheme in line with our complaints process PUS013.

Testing Methodology Testing Methodology
Airborne Sound Insulation Tests
Measurements of standardised level difference (DnT) were carried out in accordance with BS EN ISO 140-4:1998.
Level measurements in the Source & Receive Rooms (L1 & L2)
The noise was generated in the source room by placing an active loudspeaker, which produces a steady spectrum of pink noise, in an external corner of the room but at least 0.5m away from any reflective surface.
Level measurements in the Source & Receive Rooms (L1 & L2) The noise level was measured in both the source room and receive room, sampling as much of the room as possible. The sound level meter was always kept 0.7m away from any reflective surface as to not artificially increase or decrease noise levels into the microphone. The measurements were taken at one-third octave band intervals from 100 to 3150 Hertz using an average time of 30 seconds The speaker was then moved to a corner junction on two internal walls and the measurements were repeated. The measurements in each room were arithmetically averaged. For separating walls the speaker should be in a corner opposite the test wall.
Background Measurements in Receive Room (Lb) Background Measurements in Receive Room (Lb)
Background Measurements in Receive Room (Lb) Where noise levels were measured in the receive room, the background noise level was also measured with the source room speaker turned off to ensure the background noise level did not influence the result. The background noise level is measured over a time period that accurately reflects the background noise measurement at the time of the test. This is normally between 6 & 30 seconds and can vary between the first and second background measurements.
Reverberation Time Measurements (T2, T20) Reverberation Time Measurements (T2, T20)
A minimum of 6 reverberation time measurements were also taken in the receive room to accurately define the level of influence the diffuse field has on the microphone, ensuring that an increase in soft or hard surfaces does not impact the overall test result. A minimum of 6 reverberation times were measured in each room using a minimum of 3 microphone positions at each of 2 loudspeaker positions in accordance with BS EN ISO 354:2003 (also complies with BS EN 20354:1993)
Impact Sound Insulation Tests Impact Sound Insulation was conducted to BS EN ISO 140-7:1998
Reverberation Time Measurements (T2, T20) Measurements of standardised impact Sound Pressure Level (L'nT) were carried out in accordance with BS EN ISO 140-7:1998.
Level Measurements in the Receive Room Level Measurements in the Receive Room
Level Measurements in the Receive Room Copyright © SITMA 2022
Page 4 of 19 Page 4 of 19
Page 4 of 19 Level measurements were acquired in the receive room using a tapping machine, which has a set of 5 steel hammers to produce impact noise on the separating floor surface. The tapping machine was orientated at 45 degrees to the main floor axis. The noise level was measured in the receive room at 2 microphone positions at one-third octave band intervals from 100 to 3150 Hertz using an average time of at least 6 seconds for each of 4 tapping machine positions, creating 8 individual measurement readings. Measurements were always taken at least 0.7m away from any reflective or absorptive surfaces.
Background Measurements in Receive Room (Lb) Background Measurements in Receive Room (Lb)
Background Measurements in Receive Room (Lb) Where noise levels were measured in the receive room, the background noise level was also measured with the tapping machine turned off. This is to ensure the background noise level did not influence the result. The background noise level is measured over a time period that accurately reflects the background noise measurement at the time of the test. This is normally between 6 & 30 seconds and can vary between the first and second background measurements.
Reverberation Time Measurements (T2, T20) Reverberation Time Measurements (T2, T20)
A minimum of 6 reverberation times were measured in each room using a minimum of 3 microphone positions at each of 2 loudspeaker positions in accordance with BS EN ISO 354:2003 (also complies with BS EN 20354:1993)
These measurements are often the same readings as the airborne test when measured in the same group of tests where the receive room is the same and the test(s) carried out on the same day.

Calculation Methodology Calculation Methodology
Calculation Methodology Airborne Sound Insulation Tests
Background Noise Correction (‘Corrected L2') Background Noise Correction (‘Corrected L2')
Background Noise Correction (‘Corrected L2') Any receive room noise measurements that are within 6dB of the background measurements are corrected by logarithmically averaging the difference to correct the receive room measurement. The correction is applied up to 10dB, where a maximum correction of 1.6dB is applied. Any background noise level greater than 10dB over the L2 measurement will appear to reduce the sound insulation at that frequency.
Level Difference (‘D') Level Difference (‘D')
Level Difference (‘D') The difference between the source and ‘corrected’ receive room measurement is calculated for each speaker position and 2 differences averaged to obtain ‘D’ for each frequency measured. These are calculated separately for Speaker Position 1 and Speaker Position 2
Standardised Level Difference (‘DnT') Standardised Level Difference (‘DnT')
Standardised Level Difference (‘DnT') The result is standardised by adding 10 times the logarithm of half the reverberation time at each frequency to give the standardized level difference (DnT) at each frequency. These are calculated separately for Speaker Position 1 and Speaker Position 2 and are arithmetically averaged to produce final DnT,S.
Weighted Standardized Level Difference (‘DnT,w') Weighted Standardized Level Difference (‘DnT,w')
(‘DnT,w') The DnT,S are then compared to the standard reference curve as defined in BS EN ISO 717-1:1997 to give a single figure result of DnT,w.
with Spectrum Adaption (‘DnT,w + C;Ctr') Weighted Standardized Level Difference with Spectrum Adaption (‘DnT,w + C;Ctr')
Weighted Standardized Level Difference with Spectrum Adaption (‘DnT,w + C;Ctr') The spectrum adaptation terms (C;Ctr) are then calculated in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1:1997.
Precision Precision
All measurements are taken to 0.1dB precision, except reverberation times which are taken to 0.01 seconds precision.
Impact Sound Insulation Tests
Background Noise Correction (‘Corrected L2’)
Any receive room noise measurements that are within 6dB of the background measurements are corrected by logarithmically averaging the difference to correct the receive room measurement. The correction is applied up to 10dB, where a maximum correction of 1.6dB is applied. Any background noise level greater than 10dB over the L2 measurement will appear to reduce the sound insulation at that frequency.
Background Noise Correction (‘Corrected L2’) Normalized Impact Sound Pressure Level (‘L'nT’) The result is normalized by adding 10 times the logarithm of half the reverberation time at each frequency to the ‘corrected’ L2 to give the Standardized Impact Sound Pressure Level (L'nT) at each frequency.
Weighted Standardized Impact Sound Pressure Level (‘L’nT,w') Weighted Standardized Impact Sound Pressure Level (‘L’nT,w')
Weighted Standardized Impact Sound Pressure Level (‘L’nT,w') The L’nT,w are then compared to the standard reference curve as defined in BS EN ISO 717-2:1997 to give a single figure result.
Precision Precision
All measurements are taken to 0.1dB precision, except reverberation times which are taken to 0.01 seconds precision.

Sampling Regime Sampling Regime
Testing was conducted using a sampling regime in accordance with Approved Document E 2003 [as amended] (ADE), ensuring each construction type was tested on the project, not necessarily each plot.
It is assumed that each construction type is constructed consistently. If this is not the case, and deviations of the construction type occur, further testing will be required to comply with the requirements of Approved Document E 2003 [as amended] to the Building Regulations.
ADE requires that sets of tests are carried out on one in ten of each construction type or sub-group. Each set of tests on houses is made up of two airborne sound insulation tests (Two Tests). Each set of tests on flats is made up of two airborne tests on walls and two airborne and two impact tests on floors (Six Tests).
The location of the sets of tests are selected at random by the tester except where specifically requested the Approved Inspector or specialist input from Robust Details.
Rooms were tested unfurnished unless testing is specifically requested in a furnished room. Testing is conducted using the larger room as the source room, with a tolerance of 10% of volume being acceptable either way. Doors, windows and trickle vents must be closed and kitchen units, cupboard doors, wardrobes etc shall be open for the duration of the test when they have been installed against the separating wall under test.
For impact testing, the tests are always conducted on the separating floor that has received Building Control Approval.
It is only ever acceptable to test on a soft floor covering where that covering is an integral part of a Type 1 concrete floor as defined by ADE and cannot physically be lifted by the testers own hands.
Occasionally, rooms may have an awkward layout, such as a stagger, be significant in length (>10m) or contain internal barriers. These requirements are defined in EN ISO 140-14:2004 which all testers hold a copy of as a mandatory entry requirement into the SITMA scheme. Where a test has an awkward layout, the testing method from BS EN ISO 140-14:2004 will be defined in the report and sketches held internally.
Deviations Deviations
Background Noise Levels Background Noise Levels
Background Noise Levels Background noise levels are often an unavoidable part of testing as testing must take place on a live building site. Though a correction is applied within the calculation, high background noise levels may result in the wall/floor under test not achieving its full potential. Situations can occur where background noise levels are not high but the sound insulation performance of the separating floor or wall is so good that the measured levels are close to the prevailing background levels. The equipment used cannot distinguish between background noise levels and the noise from the speaker.
Deviations Related to the test Deviations Related to the test
If any deviation from the testing method was necessary, details of the deviation are indicated on each individual test certificate (appended to this report). Where deviations were avoidable, or tests have been conducted on a ‘trial’ basis, these will be highlighted at the bottom of each certificate.

Statement of Conformance Statement of Conformance
The sound level meter submitted has successfully completed the periodic tests of the standard listed for the environmental conditions under which the tests were performed. As public evidence(1) was available, from an independent testing organisation responsible for approving the results of pattern evaluation tests performed in accordance with the manufacturer's standard to demonstrate that the model of sound level meter fully conformed to the requirements of the said standard, the sound level meter submitted for testing conforms to the relevant class of the said standard.
(1 - evidence is held on file at the calibration laboratory)
Filter Calibration
The filter functions have been found to conform, by electrical testing, to the relative attenuation requirement of the standard noted over the range of frequencies shown in the attached test report.
Observations
The reported expanded uncertainty is based on a standard uncertainty multiplied by a coverage factor k = 2, providing a coverage probability of approximately 95 %. The uncertainty evaluation has been carried out in accordance with UKAS requirements. Details of the uncertainty for each measurement are available from the Calibration Laboratory upon request. Details of the sources of corrections and their associated uncertainties that relate to this verification are contained within the test report accompanying this certificate.
Decision Rule
Basic Meter Function - The decision rules will be applied in accordance with the procedure as described in BS EN 61672- 3:2006.

Method : Method :
This certificate is issued against the requirements of Annex A of both BS EN ISO 16283-2:2015 and BS EN ISO 140- 6/7:1998 in respect of regular verification and also meet the requirements of UKAS publication LAB23 covering the verification of floor tapping machines used for building acoustics applications.
The machine was inspected for mechanical soundness and tested for electrical safety. It was cleaned and lubricated in accordance with the manufacturers instructions where necessary. The cams and hammer guides were inspected to ensure a free fall of the hammers. The mass of each of the hammers was determined either by measurement or reference to historical data (see Statements overleaf) along with their curvature and diameter of the impact face. The machine was set up as per the manufacturers specification using the calibration gauge provided (where applicable) and checked for level, then the direction of fall of the hammer set was checked against the requirements of the standard. The time between successive hammer impacts was measured over a 30 second period and the mean and range of successive values calculated.
Statements:
A sucessful calibration indicates that this Tapping Machine meets the requirements of BS EN ISO 16283-2:2015 and BS EN ISO 140 parts 6, 7 & 8 annex A and is therefore suitable for the measurement of impact sound transmission following the procedures set out in their associated standards.
Expanded measurement uncertainties are:- Impact rate 0.25 ms, Hammer mass (mounted) 0.79 g, Hammer mass (demounted) 0.19 g, Hammer diameter 0.03 mm, Radius of curvature 11.0 mm, Hammer impact velocity 0.01 m/s and Hammer angle of fall 0.07 degree.
The mass of each individual hammer was measured in situ and the resulting data has been used in the calculation of the momentum of impact.

The velocity of each individual hammer was measured and averaged over 10 falls each using a light barrier measurement system to determine the friction in the system. The actual fall height and mass of each hammer were also measured and from this data both the impact velocity and momentum of impact were determined and compared against the specification in the table below.
