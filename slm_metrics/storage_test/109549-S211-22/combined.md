Where trees are protected by a Tree Preservation Order you must also provide:
Reasons for the work; and where trees are being felled

e.g. Oak (T3) - fell because of excessive shading and low amenity value. Replant with one standard ash in same position.
Sketch plan requirements

mark and name surrounding roads
sketch in buildings, including adjoining properties

marking all trees on the plan, but only numbering those to which you want to carry out work
showing the approximate distance between the application tree(s) and buildings
adding other relevant features on the site (e.g. greenhouse, paths)
If it is impossible to identify the tree(s) accurately on the plan (e.g. because they are part of a woodland or group of trees), please identify their approximate location on the plan and provide details of how the tree(s) are marked on site (e.g. high visibility tape, tree tags, paint, etc); trees must not be marked by scarring or cutting into the bark.
