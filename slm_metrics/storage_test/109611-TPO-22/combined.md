Planning Portal Reference: PP-11687543 Planning Portal Reference: PP-11687543
Where trees are protected by a Tree Preservation Order, please number them as shown in the First Schedule to the Tree Preservation Order where
this is available. You should use the same numbering on your sketch plan (see below for sketch plan requirements).
Please provide the following information:
Tree species
The number used on the sketch plan; and
A description of the proposed works.
Where trees are protected by a Tree Preservation Order you must also provide:
Reasons for the work; and where trees are being felled
Proposals for planting replacement trees (including quantity, species, position and size) or reasons for not wanting to replant.
e
Planning Portal Reference: PP-11687543 e.g. Oak (T3) - fell because of excessive shading and low amenity value. Replant with one standard ash in same position.
Sketch plan requirements Sketch plan requirements
Your plan needs to show the precise location of the tree(s) in relation to nearby property/roads/boundaries. It should, therefore:
indicate the main features of the site where the tree(s) stand and its surroundings; in particular, you should:
mark and name surrounding roads
sketch in buildings, including adjoining properties
add house numbers or names
mark the position of the tree(s) to which you want to carry out work and identify them by the number shown in the Tree Preservation Order
where possible; if you use a different number, please make sure that this can be matched with your description of the tree(s)
e
if there are many trees on the site, make clear which tree(s) are included in this application by:
marking all trees on the plan, but only numbering those to which you want to carry out work
showing the approximate distance between the application tree(s) and buildings
adding other relevant features on the site (e.g. greenhouse, paths)
Sketch plan requirements If it is impossible to identify the tree(s) accurately on the plan (e.g. because they are part of a woodland or group of trees), please identify their approximate location on the plan and provide details of how the tree(s) are marked on site (e.g. high visibility tape, tree tags, paint, etc); trees must not be marked by scarring or cutting into the bark.
Tree Ownership Tree Ownership
Is the applicant the owner of the tree(s)?
ONo
Authority Employee/Member
With respect to the Authority, is the applicant and/or agent one of the following:
(a) a member of staff
(b) an elected member
(c) related to a member of staff
(d) related to an elected member
It is an important principle of decision-making that the process is open and transparent.
For the purposes of this question, "related to" means related, by birth or otherwise, closely enough that a fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was bias on the part of the decision-maker in the Local Planning Authority.
Do any of the above statements apply?
O ONo
