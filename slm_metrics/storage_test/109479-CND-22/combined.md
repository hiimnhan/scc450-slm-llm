1.0 INTRODUCTION
KP Acoustics Ltd has been commissioned by Inform Surveying Ltd, 7, Neepsend Triangle Business Centre, 1 Burton Rd, Neepsend, Sheffield S3 8BW, to undertake a noise impact assessment of the car washing bay at Enterprise, Manchester Rd, West Timperley, Timperley, Altrincham WA14 5PH.
A 24-hour environmental noise survey and manual noise measurements have been undertaken on site in order to prepare a noise impact assessment in accordance with BS4142:2014 ‘Method for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’.
This report presents the methodology and results from the environmental survey, followed by calculations in accordance with BS4142 to provide an indication as to the likelihood of the noise emissions from washing and cleaning cars having an adverse impact on the closest noise sensitive receiver. Mitigation measures will be outlined as appropriate.

Environmental Noise Survey Procedure
Continuous automated monitoring was undertaken for the duration of the noise survey between 14.48 on 08/09/2022 and 12.04 on 09/09/2022.
In order to accurately assess the noise emissions of the car washing bay, manual measurements were undertaken at the existing car washing bay and at the nearest noise sensitive receiver. The measurement positions are described in Table 2.1 and shown in Figures 2.2 and 2.3, with the noise data presented in Section 3.2.
2.2 and 2.3, with the noise data presented in Section 3.2.
Icon Descriptor Location Description Noise Measurement Position The microphone was installed on an extendable pole approximately 2.5m above the ground level at the location shown in Figure 2.2. Manual Noise Measurement Positions Manual measurements undertaken at locations by the car wash and at the nearest noise sensitive receiver. Closest Noise Sensitive Receiver Window of 23 Clough Avenue Car Washing Bay Proposed plant installations are outlined in Section 5.1
Table 2.1 Measurement positions and description
The choice of the position was based both on accessibility and on collecting representative noise data in relation to the nearest noise sensitive receiver relative to the car wash bay installation.
Weather conditions were generally dry with light winds and therefore suitable for the measurement of environmental noise. The measurement procedure complied with ISO 1996- 2:2007 Acoustics ‘Description, measurement and assessment of environmental noise - Part 2: Determination of environmental noise levels’.

3.1 Environmental Noise Survey 3.1 Environmental Noise Survey
The LAeq: 5min, LAmax: 5min, LA10: 5min and LA90: 5min acoustic parameters were measured throughout the duration of the survey. Measured levels are shown as a time history in Figure 25303.TH1. Measured average background noise levels are shown in Table 3.1 for daytime and night-time. It should be noted that the average background noise level has been derived from the most commonly occurring LA90,5 min levels measured during the environmental noise survey undertaken on site, as shown in 25303.Daytime.LA90 and 25303.Night-time.LA90 attached.

Table 3.1 Background noise levels measured at 24 hour unattended location.
Simultaneous attended nose level measurements taken near the closest noise sensitive receiver (NSR), 23 Clough Avenue, at the location show in Figure 2.2 at the end of the 24-hour survey show that the background L90 noise level at the NSR is 3dB lower than that measured on the Enterprise site, due to attenuation from the increased distance to the A56.

It is understood that, during the survey, cars were being washed intermittently between 09.00 – 16.00hrs. Therefore, to determine a representative background noise level at the nearest NSR, the modal background noise level between the period 16.00 – 18.00hrs was used, so that measured levels were not affected by noise from the washing bay. This 2 hour period was then attenuated by 3dB to account for the distance attenuation to the NSR compared to the Enterprise site. This representative daytime background noise level at the nearest NSR is given in Table 3.2 below.

3.2 Manual Noise Measurements 3.2 Manual Noise Measurements
Noise measurements of cars being washed with the jet washer and cleaned with the vacuum cleaner were taken by the car wash bay and at the nearest NSR. It was noted from conversations with operatives on site that on average, a car takes approximately 5 minutes to wash and 5 minutes to vacuum. Background noise levels taken before and after the car wash operations. The LAeq,5 minute measurements for the each measurement position is presented in Table 3.3 below.

NOISE ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE NOISE ASSESSMENT GUIDANCE
BS4142: 2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’
British Standard BS4142:2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ describes a method for rating and assessing sound of an industrial and/or commercial nature, which includes:
industrial and manufacturing processes
fixed installations which comprise mechanical and electrical plant and
equipment
• Sound from the loading and unloading of goods and materials at industrial and/or
commercial premises, and
• Sound from mobile plant and vehicles that is an intrinsic part of the overall sound
emanating from premises or processes.
This Standard compares the Rating Level due to the noise source/s under assessment for a one-hour period during the daytime (07:00 – 23:00 hours) and a fifteen-minute period during the night-time (23:00 – 07:00 hours) with the existing background noise level in terms of an LA90 when the noise source is not operating.
It should be noted that the Rating Level is the Specific Sound Level in question (LAeq, Tr), including any relevant acoustic feature corrections, as follows:
• Tonality – ‘For sound ranging from not tonal to prominently tonal the Joint Nordic
Method gives a correction of between 0dB and +6dB for tonality. Subjectively, this can be converted to a penalty of 2dB for a tone which is just perceptible at the noise receptor, 4dB where it is clearly perceptible, and 6dB where it is highly perceptible’
•
Impulsivity – ‘A correction of up to +9dB can be applied for sound that is highly impulsive, considering both the rapidity of the change in sound level and the overall change in sound level. Subjectively, this can be converted to a penalty of 3dB for impulsivity which is just perceptible at the noise receptor, 6dB where it is clearly perceptible, and 9dB where it is highly perceptible’
•
Intermittency – ‘If the intermittency is readily distinctive against the residual acoustic environment, a penalty of 3dB can be applied’
25303: Enterprise, 309 Manchester Road, Altrincham BS4142 Assessment
Page 6 of 10
25303.BS4142.01
• Other sound characteristics – ‘Where the specific sound features characteristics that are neither tonal nor impulsive, though otherwise are readily distinctive against the residual acoustic environment, a penalty of 3dB can be applied’
Once the Rating Level has been obtained, the representative background sound level is subtracted from the Rating Level to obtain an initial estimate of the impact, as follows:
Typically, the greater this difference, the greater the magnitude of the impact
A difference of around +10 dB or more is likely to be an indication of a significant
adverse impact, depending on the context
• A difference of around +5 dB could be an indication of an adverse impact, depending
on the context
• The lower the rating level is relative to the measured background sound level, the less likely it is that there will be an adverse impact or significant adverse impact. Where the rating level does not exceed the background sound level, this is an indication of the specific sound having a low impact, depending on the context
NOTE: Adverse impacts may include but not be limited to annoyance and sleep disturbance. Not all adverse impacts will lead to complaints and not every complaint is proof of an adverse impact.
The initial estimate of the impact may then be modified by taking consideration of the context in which the sound occurs.
5.0 BS4142 ASSESSMENT
A new car wash bay is proposed at Enterprise, 309 Manchester Road, Altringham, at the location of the existing car wash bay. It is understood that this will be in use intermittently between 08.00 – 17.00hrs Monday – Friday and 09.00 – 12.00hrs Saturdays.
As shown in Figure 2.2, a residential receiver is located approximately 30m to the rear of the car wash bay.
Further to discussions with the car wash operative, it is understood that the car wash operates intermittently during daytime hours between 08:00 and 17:00hrs. It is assumed that 5 cars are washed and cleaned in an hour with 5x5 minute vacuuming and 5x5 minute jet washing sessions per hour.

Table 5.2 shows the results of the predictions for the car wash to the closest noise sensitive receiver, based on an assessment period of 1 hour for daytime as per BS4142:2014.
5.1 Calculations
The ‘Specific Sound Level’ of the car wash bay has been calculated at 1m from the closest receiver using the noise levels shown in Table 5.1, and corrected due to different acoustic propagation features such as distance, reflective surfaces, screening elements, etc.
The ‘Rating Level’ of the car washing bay been assessed following the guidelines of BS4142 for the daytime period when the bay would be operational, with a subsequent conclusion taking into consideration the above context. The full BS4142 assessment is presented in Table 5.1.

Assessment Indication
Noise from the car wash operation would be equivalent to the background sound level at 1m from
the façade of the closest residential dwelling (23 Clough Avenue).
This corresponds to a low likelihood of adverse impact in accordance with BS4142:2014 guidance.

Decibel scale - dB Decibel scale - dB
scale - dB In practice, when sound intensity or sound pressure is measured, a logarithmic scale is used in which the unit is the ‘decibel’, dB. This is derived from the human auditory system, where the dynamic range of human hearing is so large, in the order of 107? units, that only a logarithmic scale is the sensible solution for displaying such a range.
scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A) Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A)
The human ear is less sensitive at frequency extremes, below 125Hz and above 16Khz. A sound level meter models the ears variable sensitivity to sound at different frequencies. This is achieved by building a filter into the Sound Level Meter with a similar frequency response to that of the ear, an A-weighted filter where the unit is dB(A).
Leq
Decibel scale, ‘A’ weighted - dB(A) The sound from noise sources often fluctuates widely during a given period of time. An average value can be measured, the equivalent sound pressure level Leg. The Leg is the equivalent sound level which would deliver the same sound energy as the actual fluctuating sound measured in the same time period.
Lio Lio
Lio This is the level exceeded for no more than 10% of the time. This parameter is often used as a “not to exceed” criterion for noise.
Leo Leo
Leo This is the level exceeded for no more than 90% of the time. This parameter is often used as a descriptor of “background noise” for environmental impact studies.
Lmax Lmax
Lmax This is the maximum sound pressure level that has been measured over a period.
Octave Bands Octave Bands
In order to completely determine the composition of a sound it is necessary to determine the sound level at each frequency individually. Usually, values are stated in octave bands. The audible frequency region is divided into 11 such octave bands whose centre frequencies are defined in accordance with international standards. These centre frequencies are: 16, 31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and 16000 Hertz.
Environmental noise terms are defined in BS7445, Description and Measurement of Environmental Noise.

APPENDIX A APPENDIX A
APPLIED ACOUSTIC TERMINOLOGY APPLIED ACOUSTIC TERMINOLOGY
Addition of noise from several sources Addition of noise from several sources
Addition of noise from several sources Noise from different sound sources combines to produce a sound level higher than that from any individual source. Two equally intense sound sources operating together produce a sound level which is 3B higher than a single source and 4 sources produce a 6dB higher sound level.
Attenuation by distance Attenuation by distance
Attenuation by distance Sound which propagates from a point source in free air attenuates by 6dB for each doubling of distance from the noise source. Sound energy from line sources (e.g. stream of cars) drops off by 3dB for each doubling of distance.
Subjective impression of noise Subjective impression of noise
Hearing perception is highly individualised. Sensitivity to noise also depends on frequency content, time of occurrence, duration of sound and psychological factors such as emotion and expectations. The following table is a guide to explain increases or decreases in sound levels for many scenarios.
Change in sound level (dB) Change in perceived loudness 1 Imperceptible 3 Just barely perceptible 6 Clearly noticeable 10 About twice as loud
Transmission path(s)
The transmission path is the path the sound takes from the source to the receiver. Where multiple paths exist in parallel, the reduction in each path should be calculated and summed at the receiving point. Outdoor barriers can block transmission paths, for example traffic noise. The effectiveness of barriers is dependent on factors such as its distance from the noise source and the receiver, its height and construction.
Ground-borne vibration
In addition to airborne noise levels caused by transportation, construction, and industrial sources there is also the generation of ground-borne vibration to consider. This can lead to structure-borne noise, perceptible vibration, or in rare cases, building damage.
Sound insulation - Absorption within porous materials
Upon encountering a porous material, sound energy is absorbed. Porous materials which are intended to absorb sound are known as absorbents, and usually absorb 50 to 90% of the energy and are frequency dependent. Some are designed to absorb low frequencies, some for high frequencies and more exotic designs being able to absorb very wide ranges of frequencies. The energy is converted into both mechanical movement and heat within the material; both the stiffness and mass of panels affect the sound insulation performance.
