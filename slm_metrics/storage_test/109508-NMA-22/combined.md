under section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 against a refusal to grant planning permission.
by Lidl UK/Orchard Street Investment Management LLP.
application Ref 98127/FUL/19, dated 24 May 2019 was refused by notice dated 16 July 2020.
development proposed is the extension, refurbishment and subdivision of the existing Homebase store to provide a downsized unit for Homebase and a new class A1 retail unit to be occupied by Lidl. The application also proposes the relocation of the Homebase garden centre, the reconfiguration of the existing car park and associated landscaping and the creation of a new egress from the site.
Decision
1. The appeal is allowed, and planning permission is granted for the extension, refurbishment and subdivision of the existing Homebase store to provide a downsized unit for Homebase and a new class A1 retail unit to be occupied by Lidl. The application also proposes the relocation of the Homebase garden centre, the reconfiguration of the existing car park and associated landscaping and the creation of a new egress from the site at Altringham Retail Park, Unit 1, George Richards Way, Altringham WA14 5GR in accordance with the terms of the application ref 98127/FUL/19, dated 24 May 2019, subject to the conditions outlined at annex A at the end of this decision.
Preliminary Matters
2. Following the submission of this appeal, the appellant sought planning permission for the same development at the appeal site albeit with a different vehicular egress arrangement at the site. This proposal was approved by a decision notice issued on 8 April 2021. This proposal, known as the ‘second application’ was the subject of a claim for judicial review which was refused on 15 July 2021. It was then subject to an oral (renewal) hearing which remained outstanding when the inquiry sat and the evidence was heard. Following the close of the inquiry, the appellant confirmed on 7 December 2021 that the oral (renewal) hearing in respect of the ‘second application’ had been refused. All parties were provided with an opportunity to comment on this.
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate
3. A replacement access drawing was submitted prior to the inquiry opening. The revised access arrangement mirrored the access proposed by the ‘second application’ on the site. It was subject to a separate consultation. The Council did not object to the plan being substituted and all parties had an opportunity to comment on the drawings. The Council and the appellant agreed that this arrangement would have an acceptable impact on highways safety and as a result, reason for refusal number 2 on the decision notice was not contested at the appeal. I do not consider anybody would be prejudice by my taking this drawing into account and have considered the appeal on this basis. Notwithstanding this position and in light of third party and Rule 6 representations in relation to this issue, this topic was still subject to discussion as part of the inquiry.
4. As a consequence of this substituted plan, the Council confirmed that they would no longer contest the appeal.
5. In addition to the development plan, I have also been referred to the policies contained within the emerging local plan. However, given the fact that the policies within the emerging plan are at Regulation 18 stage only, I have attached no weight to them in reaching my conclusions below.
Main Issue
6. In light of the above, the main issue is:
Main Issue • Whether the proposal satisfactorily addresses the sequential test.
Reasons Reasons
Whether the proposal satisfactorily addresses the sequential test
7. It was common ground between all parties that:
The appeal site is within an out of centre location. As a result, there is a requirement to demonstrate compliance with the sequential test as set out at paragraphs 87 of the Framework;
There is a sequential preferable site known as the Altair site. This site is allocated under policy W2.3 of the Trafford Core Strategy, 2012 as the main development opportunity within Altringham Town Centre immediately to the east of the Altringham transport interchange (although it was generally accepted by all parties that the site was edge of centre despite this definition within the Core Strategy);
8. The dispute focuses on the availability and suitability for this site to accommodate the appeal proposal, including the scope to which the appeal proposal should be disaggregated. As a result, I deal with each of these matters in turn.
Availability of the Altair site
9. There can be no dispute that the development of the Altair site has been subject to significant delays. However, the Council contend that a revised planning application will be submitted imminently. Given the evidence I heard from the appellant, notwithstanding the significant delays which have occurred even prior to the current coronavirus pandemic, I can see no reason to disagree that this will be the case. The site is clearly sequentially preferable,
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 2
being located on the edge of Altringham and within close proximity to Altringham transport interchange within the town.
10. There was agreement between the Council and the appellant that the delivery timeframe for the Altair site would be between 3-4 years. In my view, this presents a reasonable timeframe, and the suggested timeline for development by Lidl in terms of the application, development and delivery process would also all appear to be reasonable. Whilst I fully acknowledge that the delivery of the Altair site has not been forthcoming, there is no evidence before me to suggest that the 3-4 year period envisaged by the appellant could not reasonably be achieved. As such, I am of the view that the Altair site would present a sequentially preferable site which is available within a reasonable timeframe.
Suitability of the Altair site (including disaggregation)
11. Disaggregation is not a requirement of the sequential test. However, the PPG is clear that the application of the sequential test will need to be proportionate and appropriate for the given proposals. The Framework is also clear at paragraph 88 that when considering edge and out of centre proposals, applicants and local planning authorities should demonstrate flexibility on issues such as format and scale. It goes on to note that preference should be given to accessible sites which are well connected to the town centre. Disaggregation is a matter of planning judgement to be addressed on a case- by-case basis. As such, it is important to consider the particular circumstances of each case and the flexibility which can realistically be applied to the proposals. In this case, the proposal seeks to introduce a new retailer in the form of Lidl to the existing out of centre retail park. As a single unit, it is both proportionate and reasonable to consider flexibility in both the format and scale of the proposal and the creation of the new foodstore proposed. However, given that the Homebase is an existing operator, it would be plainly wrong to require this existing use at the site to be considered as part of this exercise.
12. The Homebase comprises an existing store operating from the retail park. The appellants witness contends that the Homebase store and proposed Lidl foodstore are ‘functionally linked’. However this ‘functional’ relationship appears to focus on reducing the lease liability for Homebase. I am unable to agree that this amounts to a ‘functional’ relationship which would negate the need to consider disaggregating the Lidl from the Homebase. Whilst the co- location of the two retailers may be beneficial from a trading perspective, there is no reliance or functional relationship which would mean that disaggregating the Lidl store should be discounted. There is no clear functional connection. I am not convinced that the reconfiguration of the Homebase could only take place in association with the Lidl store and the scheme before me. No evidence was presented regarding alterative trading options which may have been considered in order to provide a smaller footprint and deliver the more modern store desired by Homebase. Given the current retail climate, the situation at this site cannot be described as particularly unique or one which would provide sufficient justification to negate the requirement to consider disaggregation on this basis alone.
13. The consideration of the suitability of the Altair site for the Lidl unit only is entirely consistent with the general thrust of the guidance and in particular a consideration of what contribution more central sites are able to make
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 3
individually to accommodate the proposal. In my view, it is both reasonable and necessary to disaggregate the Lidl store from the Homebase.
14. Lidl has committed to operating a smaller format store from the Altair site, a metropolitan format. The appellant confirmed that Lidl had exchanged contracts with Nikal, the developer controlling the Altair site and is committed to being the anchor tenant for the scheme delivering a metropolitan format store on a leasehold basis as part of the wider mixed use residential led scheme being delivered here. I acknowledge that this store would be reliant on higher pedestrian footfalls than the appeal site, reflective of the fact that the store would be served directly off the pedestrianised high street. It would have a reduced range of goods as a result of the smaller format (a sales area approximately 15% smaller than the appeal scheme) and would be likely to have access to a shared underground car park. To my mind, this commitment to the Altair site demonstrates the commitment to flexibility on format and scale envisaged by the Framework.
Conclusion on the sequential test
15. Applying suitable flexibility to the scale and format of the development proposed, there is a more centrally available and suitable site, the Altair site. The sequential test requires more centrally available and suitable sites to come forward in advance of less central sites. The Altair site presents both a suitable and available site in the context of the sequential test. As a result, the proposal does not satisfy the sequential test and would fail to accord with policy S11 of the Revised Trafford Unitary Development Plan 2006 as well as policy W2 of the Trafford Core Strategy, 2012. Policy S11 provides the policy context for development outside of established centres. It advises, amongst other things, that proposals will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated that a sequential approach to site selection has been adopted.
16. Policy W2 advises, amongst other things, that outside of the defines centres, there will be a presumption against the development of retail, leisure and other town-centre type uses except where it can be demonstrated that they satisfy the tests outlined in current Government Guidance. The policy goes on to note that proposals to expand any of the existing retail parks (of which the Altringham Retail Park is defined) should be justified against the tests set out in national guidance. The guidance continues at paragraph 91 of the Framework and advises that where an application fails to satisfy the sequential test or is likely to have significant adverse impacts on one or more of the considerations in paragraph 90, it should be refused.
Other Matters
The effect of the proposed new vehicular entrance point onto George Richards Way in terms of highways safety
17. A new vehicular egress would be created from George Richard Way. This new egress would mean that the location of the egress would be 20m further west away from the junction with the A56. The central traffic island has also been extended west to prevent right turns into and out of the egress. The gradient of the egress has also been reduced and lengthened and the proposal now includes for the widening of the carriageway to achieve minimum 3m wide traffic lanes, excluding the central hatched road markings. The revised access arrangement is supported by additional analysis including a swept path analysis
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 4
and including vehicle tracking speeds. In light of the submitted transport assessment as well as the statement of common ground between the Council and the appellant, I am satisfied that the proposed access arrangements provide a safe and suitable access. I can see no technical evidence that would cause me to take a different view.
18. A number of local residents expressed concerns regarding the highway’s implications of the development in terms of the existing volume of traffic and the impact of the proposed Lidl store. I am satisfied that the technical transport assessment in support if the appeal proposal, which tested the increase levels of traffic on the local highway network on both a weekday peak and Saturday midday peak provides sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in a material change in traffic conditions during peak periods. I also note the particular concerns expressed regarding the potential for customer parking to take place on surrounding residential roads. In this regard, I am satisfied that the proposal would provide for an acceptable level of car parking on site.
19. Accordingly, I conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to highways safety. The proposal would therefore accord with policy L4 of the Trafford Core Strategy, 2012 which states, amongst other things, that the Council will not grant planning permission for development that is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the safe and efficient operation of the strategic road network, the primary and local highway network unless and until appropriate transport infrastructure improvements and/or traffic mitigation measures and the programme for implementation is secured. In addition, the proposal would also accord with paragraph 111 of the Framework which states that development should only be prevented on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.
The effect of the proposed development on the setting of the nearby listed building The Railway Inn Public House
20. Section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires that special regard shall be had to the desirability of preserving a listed building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest that it possesses. It is therefore necessary to consider the effect of the appeal proposal on the setting of the listed building itself.
21. In the case of this appeal, the heritage asset concerned is the Railway Inn, a grade II listed public house. Historically, the retail park itself originally formed part of the Broadheath Railway Station, goods yard and viaduct. It is widely accepted that the ‘setting’ comprises the surrounds in which a heritage asset is experienced. From what I saw on my site visits, the Railway Inn is located on the corner of the existing car park in a somewhat isolated fashion. It is located at the junction with Manchester Road and George Richards Way. Its setting is experienced from the front elevation of the building when travelling north and south along Manchester Road.
22. The existing main road frontage, signalised junction, surface level car park associated with the retail park and wider retail warehousing situated along George Richards Way and within the immediate vicinity of the heritage asset. The heritage asset is within the appeal site by virtue of the fact that it is located within the corner of the existing surface level car park. From my
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 5
observations, there is very limited intervisibility between the appeal site and the Railway Inn. In the context of these characteristics, it is my view that the special interest of the building is derived from the frontages facing the public highway.
23. The appeal proposal would introduce built development closer to the heritage asset concerned, through the construction of the proposed garden centre extension which would be positioned closer to Manchester Road. In this way, the proposal may, to a certain limited degree, reduce the visible separation between the heritage asset and the existing retail units. I accept that such a reduction would have a permanent effect. In accordance with paragraph 202 of the Framework, it is common ground between the Council and the appellant that the harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset would be less that substantial. From my assessment set out above, I concur with this view. Notwithstanding this position, it would amount to harm to the setting of a listed building and as a result, the proposal would conflict with policy R1 of the Trafford Core Strategy, 2012 in so far as this policy is consistent with the Framework.
Design
24. Concerns were expressed that the design of the proposed new retail unit would fail to provide an acceptable level of design. To my mind, the design of the proposal would be entirely in keeping with the surrounding built environment in terms of its scale, mass and bulk. It would be reflective of the established pattern of townscape in the area which is in the round reflective of the retail park environment. The proposal would not result in any material harm in this regard, and I find no conflict with policy L7 of the Core Strategy which requires, amongst other things, that development must be appropriate to its context and enhance the character of the area by appropriately addressing factors such as height and massing.
Other Appeal Decisions
25. The main parties have referred me to a number of other retail appeal decisions and case law1 . I have had due regard to the consideration of these other decisions and the specific detail of the case law referred to in so far as it applies to the main issue before me. I acknowledge that in a number of these cases, the application of the sequential test and the requirements for disaggregation have been considered and applied to the specific circumstances of the appeals to which they relate. I am also mindful of the fact that these other appeals do not present the exact same circumstances presented here. In a number of cases, the proposals relate to large scale out of centre proposals2 or indeed proposals where no end operator had been identified3. In other cases, there are a number of other significant main issues beyond the issue of the sequential test or the sequential sites4 considered do not share similar characteristics to those at the Altair site. Some of the decisions predate the Framework5. The comparisons I can draw are at best limited. In all cases, the appeal must be decided on the particular circumstances of the case. The

https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 6
similarities and thus weight I attach to these numerous other cases referred to is limited.
The Fall Back Position
26. The appeal site has a grant of planning permission for the same development as the appeal scheme before me. In my view, this represents a fall back position to which weight should be attributed as part of the overall planning balance. I return to this matter below.
Planning Balance and Overall Conclusion
27. The starting point is the development plan. As the proposal would fail to satisfy the sequential test, it would conflict with policy S11 of the Unitary Development Plan as well as policy W2 of the Core Strategy. The Framework is also clear that in these circumstances, a proposal should not usually be granted. I attach significant weight to this conflict.
28. As paragraph 199 of the Framework makes clear, when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset great weight should be given to the asset’s conservation. In respect of the Railway Inn, section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires that special regard shall be had to the desirability of preserving a listed building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.
29. Given that the harm identified in respect of the setting of the heritage asset would be ‘less than substantial’ in the terms of the Framework, it is necessary – in line with paragraph 202 of the Framework – that it should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal. It is not disputed that public benefits would arise from the appeal scheme. The development would result in the creation of approximately 40 new jobs associated with the foodstore, as well as jobs (albeit on a temporary basis) during the construction phase. I attach moderate weight to these factors in the balancing exercise. It would also mean that approximately 50 existing jobs at the Homebase store would be protected. Recognising the correspondence from Homebase on this matter and balancing this against the conclusions I have drawn above regarding the operation of the Homebase store, I attach limited weight to this factor. There will also be public benefits in terms of additional investment within the retail park itself – a factor to which I have also attached weight. I conclude that these public benefits of the scheme would outweigh the less than substantial harm to the heritage asset concerned.
30. Turning to consider the other material considerations, the development would also improve customer choice, whilst maximising the use of brownfield land. I attach moderate weight to these factors.
31. A fall back position exists in the form of the ‘second application’ whereby planning permission exists for a near identical scheme. In my view there is a real prospect that this scheme could be implemented. I have attached significant weight to this factor in the overall planning balance.
32. Notwithstanding the clear policy conflict I have identified, the above factors, when considered collectively represent other material considerations which weigh in favour of the proposal. For this reason and having regard to all other matters raised, I allow the appeal.
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 7
Conditions
33. A draft list of planning conditions was submitted prior to the start of the inquiry, and this facilitated a ‘round table’ discussion involving all parties. I have considered the various conditions in light of that discussion and the advice contained within paragraph 56 of the Framework. The appellant has also confirmed in writing acceptance to the pre commencement conditions attached.
34. Conditions relating to the commencement of the development and the approved plans are required. In this instance, the parties have agreed that the development should be begun within one year beginning with the date of this decision. This is both reasonable and necessary in light of the commercial aspirations of the operator. In order to ensure a satisfactory quality of design, it is also reasonable and necessary to include conditions requiring the external materials as well as hard and soft landscaping details to be subject to the approval of the Council. A condition requiring the ongoing maintenance of the soft landscaping through replacement planting for the lifetime of the development is necessary to ensure the site remains satisfactorily landscaped.
35. As the site is in an out of centre location, conditions restricting any further subdivision of the units and the range of goods which can be sold from each of the units are necessary to protect the vitality and viability of the neighbouring centres.
36. In the interest of highways safety, conditions relating to the provision of the new egress onto George Richards Way, the submission of a travel plan, the submission of the design and provision of a 2.15m height restriction barrier at the egress as well as the requirement to provide the visibility splays necessary are required. In order to ensure adequate parking provision is made available, a condition is also necessary to secure the car parking, servicing and cycle parking as shown on the plans prior to the use of the units. Furthermore, a condition requiring the details of the motorcycle parking to be submitted and installed in order to ensure satisfactory provision is made for motorcycle parking within the development. Finally, a condition requiring a scheme for the provision of electric vehicle charging infrastructure is to be submitted and approved and implemented there after in order to ensure the development makes adequate provision for such facilities.
37. A condition is required to address the flood risk and provide an outline drainage strategy at the site is necessary in order to minimise flood risk. A further condition is attached to ensure that the development shall be drained via separate systems for the disposal of foul and surface water.
38. In view of the proximity of neighbouring residential properties, it is reasonable to attach a number of conditions which are all necessary to ensure that the development has an acceptable impact on residential amenity. These include a condition requiring details of a construction management plan as well as a servicing and delivery management plan. In addition, a condition requiring the development to be constructed in accordance with the Noise Impact Assessment submitted is also reasonable and necessary for the same reason. A further condition is included limiting the noise levels from fixed plant and
https://www.gov.uk/planning-inspectorate 8
machinery at the development. A condition relating to any external lighting proposed at the site is also covered. For the same reasons, I have also included conditions restricting the opening hours of both units.
39. Conditions requiring the submission of a site investigation and risk assessment and subsequent verification report are necessary to ensure the safe development of the site. In the interests of crime prevention and community safety, a condition is also included requiring the development to be completed in accordance with the submitted crime impact assessment.
40. A condition requiring the submission of a ecological survey is both necessary and reasonable to prevent any bird habitat disturbance at the site. For the same reason, I have also included a condition requiring the submission and installation of replacement bird boxes. Furthermore, a condition requiring an updated bat survey report is necessary to protect any protected species on the site.
